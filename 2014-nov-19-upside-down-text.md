This is going to seem awfully rambly, I'll try to keep it short.

I have identified that reading text upside down is more difficult. The scale
goes like this: baseline is reading normally, then there's reading letters and
words that are upside down, then letters and words that are mirrored, and
finally, although I haven't tested it recently, letters and words that are both
mirrored and upside down. This is obviously a scale that goes from easiest to
harder. Not *hardest*, as I'm sure there's more complex variants (applying a
random tranformation out of those four to every single letter and then again to
every single word comes to mind as a simple but really-hard-to-read variant).

Say you are wearing a t-shirt with some text on it. To an outside observer, the
text is upright, difficulty level 0. Now look down at your own t-shirt: is the
text upright or upside down? I.e. is reading it level 0 or 1? Now take the
bottom hem of your t-shirt and raise it, up towards your face, so that the
fabric is now roughly at the same level as your face, and try again. Note the
results.

For me, in the first instance, the text looked upright, level 0; in the second
instance, the text looked upside down, level 1.

However, if I look at this from outside my own experience, and think of my eyes
as cameras, the text was upside down all the time. NEVERMIND I FIGURED IT OUT I
AM STUPID.
