1  
alarms blaring  
it's night. what's  
happening?

2  
i hear questions  
yells  
cries  
incomprehension  
no answer

3  
someone comes  
"something happened"  
"we're moving everyone"  
"can you walk?"  
blink twice  

4  
i *can* walk  
my burns hurt  
but i can walk  
almost happy but  
panic fear blindness

5  
sit down  
place is crowded  
can hear breaths  
people moving

6  
people  
make noise  
even though  
everything  
is silent
