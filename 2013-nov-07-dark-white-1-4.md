It had taken most of the night, but hours after midnight mom finally made me go to bed. "You need sleep more than answers right now." she said, and added "That is not negotiable." when I opened my mouth in protest. So I resolved to protest in silence, dumping all I've learned here to ellude sleep until I can no longer hold it off.

Once upon a time was a witch named Fahin Morrigan. No one knows where she came from, how she got her name, or what deal she made with the devil to get such maddeningly powerful magic. We learn that in school. Okay, maybe not that last part, because people tend to rever her and they would never ever insinuate she had made a pact with any dark god, spirit, or other such entity. So people just say "hey she was powerful and nobody knows why can we just leave it at that" and then go off and do exactly that.

After a few years lobbing fireballs at bandits and juggling with spiky steel balls infused with magic, or the inverse, the records aren't clear, she fell in love with some random nobody noone had ever heard off, disappeared from the world, had kids, and honed her craft in peace and quiet and away from every curious paparazzi out there. Still normal school stuff.

Finally, after two decades or so, she reappeared under the name Aléh. Aléh never did say she was Fahin, but she had the same build and looks, albeit older, as well as magic that was orders of magnitude above everyone else's. She went straight to the local Magic Academy, taught a class so advanced only the brightest of the bright managed to follow, and then moved on to other Schools and Institutes. After about another decade, the entire known magical had made this huge leap forward but was still centuries behind Aléh. So she wrote a bunch of books, gave them to scholars and wizards to study, and then traveled north to explore and was never seen again. End of school history, now comes the family story.
