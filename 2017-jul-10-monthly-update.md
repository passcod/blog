## List

I watched [Neil Gaiman speaking to students][commencement-speech] last week, and
it reminded me that I did have specific things I've wanted to do forever. Unlike
Gaiman, though, I've never noted them anywhere, so I'll search my memories and
write them down here as I find them again:

- I want to invent something.
- I want to publish a scientific paper.
- I want to forge a blade.
- I want to travel to Antarctica.
- I want to pilot a glider.
- I want to learn a martial art with a staff.
- I want to build a giant machine.
- I want to live in a lighthouse for a bit.
- I want to publish a novel.
