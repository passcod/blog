  <h2>Keycasting</h2>
<p>I have been spending most of the month <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1106093907174027265">trying</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1107512847821492225">cast a key</a> in epoxy. It’s
an interesting project to be sure, even if I’m doubtful as to its actual
success. Learning lots, making mistakes, making discoveries.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>I also moved on the first of the month. I now live in a much larger place than
before, although still by my lonesome! (I’m not complaining, I like it, it’s why
I chose it.) It’s got no carpet anywhere, fake-wood laminate plank and dark tile
floors, two storeys, ample parking space, in the middle of town but also in the
middle of greenery (although none I have to tend to), and honestly I like it a
lot. The rent is a bit high, but it’s not outrageous, either.</p>
<p>Consequently I’ve spent a while finding furniture and making things work. Stuff
is expensive! Sheesh. I did get some good deals, and with a bit of DIY and
low-key restoration I think I’ll get a nice setup out of it all. And it keeps my
hands busy!</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>After 10 months of work we’ve finally released a new customer website. Won’t
really say much about it here, but it’s good to be done, even if we’ll keep on
working on features. Relief and accomplishment.</p>
<p>We worked pretty hard to get it ready and launched before April, as no-one wants
to seriously release a new product around April Fools! Google can do its thing,
we’ll keep to not trying to surprise and upset our customers (yes I’m still
bitter about the Inbox thing).</p>
<h2>Notify</h2>
<p>I’ve been preparing for a breaking release of the main branch. In the last few
days I’ve finalised the feature list of what I want in there; I’m taking the
opportunity to bundle a bunch of changes into it. I’m aiming for a mid-April
release, but plans do go awry around this project, so who knows.</p>
<p>This will be a good way to test how fast the adoption is. I’m expecting a few
months of earnest transition, followed by a long tail… maybe by the end of the
year it will be over, but I’m not holding my breath.</p>
<h2>Armstrong &amp; Reasonable</h2>
<p>On hold for now.</p>
<h2>Trebuchet</h2>
<p>A new little project on the same proto-framework as I made for Armstrong. I want
to use a few features of Btrfs around volumes to make a lightweight deployment &amp;
artifact system. Aimed at small deployments of a few machines or projects, for
small teams or individuals. A lot of stuff in the space is made for super large
scale, and doesn’t make sense — despite hype — otherwise.</p>
