  <h2>Donations</h2>
<p>This year I decided to forgo donating to organisations. This had many reasons,
most of which boiled down to most organisations sending me about a ream of paper
each in “pwease donate” advertising throughout this year, which I gather doesn’t
come cheap, so at my support level I estimate they spent at least half of my
dollars on asking me more dollars, which is ridiculous. I’m sure they also do
good work, I’m not sure they particularly need <em>my</em> cash to do that.</p>
<p>One organisation that is the exception, and the sole organisation in my donation
list this year is <a href="https://papa.org.nz/">PAPA</a>, and I gave them $300 sometime back in May.</p>
<p>So here I was wondering what I should do. One thing I’ve always wanted to do
since I started doing this regularly but was never really sure how to is direct
donation, i.e. “just giving people money.” So this year, starting in November, I
went and actually tried that. I figured out the parameters and made <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1198020442444795904">a tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friends, it’s donation season, point me to (New Zealand) queer and non-binary
people in need of help. I’ll fund (at my discretion, t&amp;c apply, standard
disclaimer, etc etc) until I reach this year’s donation budget.</p>
<p>(Budget not specified because not completely nailed down, but is somewhere
around $1500.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t really get many returns but then I trawled givealittle for matching
people and donated there too. By December 3rd I had spent about ⅔ the budget and
exhausted my search to this point, so I resolved to take two weeks before trying
again.</p>
<p>On December 20th, JK Rowling made an extremely TERFy tweet and I was kinda mad.
I was seeing a lot of condemnation from allies but not a lot of action. It’s
kinda hard to do anything to Rowling, though. Instead, I had <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1207897429447565315">this idea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In honour of JK Rowling… /s</p>
<p>I’m opening <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1198020442444795904">this</a> up to non-NZ, trans people in priority. I have
about $500 left in budget. Anything left at the end of the year will go to
<a href="https://www.ry.org.nz/">RY</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in need, raise your hand (DM me your paypal or something); if you
know someone in need, point me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were a lot more people answering, and I was able to help all of them. So
that was a huge success. In total, I distributed more than $1500 to more than
twenty people, many of them trans, many of them in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an economic, macro-level kinda thing, donating all $1500 to <a href="https://www.ry.org.nz/">RY</a>
would have helped more people, but it’s harder to see. And of course, none of
the people I gave money to are registered charities, so I won’t get any tax
rebate for the 2019 tax year. That’s alright. I mostly want to help people, and
this year I did that by distributing what is to me a little bit of cash to
people for whom it is a lot.</p>
<p>We’ll see what next year brings.</p>
