## Conferences

## Books

### Bought
### Backed

## Donations

Every year that I am able to, I try to give some portion of my salary away in
donations to various organisations and charities I believe make the world a
better place. This year I decided on a budget of $3000.

All amounts are in NZ dollars, even if the donation was in another currency.

### Extrabudgetary

As a special occasion, I donated $365 to the Internet Archive in the form of my
remaining [stash of bitcoin][ia-btc] when I decided "that's it, I'm out".

### Individuals

$100 were given directly to individuals.

### Organisations

This year I decided on an increased focus on local and regional queer and
indigenous organisations, or organisations with other focuses but led and
involving queer and indigenous individuals. I also kept last year's point on
funding critical internet social infrastructure.

However, I specifically excluded organisations that spent most of the year
sending me luscious printed advertising material, especially after requests to
stop, and, in some cases, entrapping and misleading phone calls and phone
harassment (repeatedly after being told to stop) to get me to donate more and/or
more frequently. I do not and will not support this use of their resources.

### ██████████████████████

As part of a focus to fund internet social infrastructure, I offered a $1200
████████ to ███████████████ for the purposes of getting ███████████████████████
up and running.

(This is not yet announced, but is part of the budget. More news next year!)

### Open source funding

//

### Patreon

Aside from my regular donations, I also gave $xxx to various creators on Patreon.


## Fanfiction

### Written

 - [How to Fall to the Dark Side in Ten Minutes and Save Jerks from Themselves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13125189/chapters/30026574)

### Read

Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don't include fics I read but didn't like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn't include all
I read that _wasn't_ fanfic (yet, but I'm working on that for next year!).

After doing some sampling during the year, I have measured that I read about
120k words of fanfic _updates_ per _week_.
