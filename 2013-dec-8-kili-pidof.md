This character started only as "Professor Pidof".
[pidof](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pidof) is a \*nix utility I've never used,
because [pgrep](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pgrep) does the work better.
Nevertheless, I had started with "Pido", then realised it might be taken as a
reference or derivative of "Pedo" which wasn't my intention (and if it ever is,
I'll be more subtle about it, that one's not very clever). "Pidof" was a joke,
initially, then I forgot it on my whiteboard and it stuck.

"Kili" came later, as a variation on "Kieru" (æ¶ˆ),
["Kira"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Yagami), "Kill", which is [a
much-used related
utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_%28command%29#Unix_and_Unix-like).
It helps that this is the name of a man who could `kill -9` you and evade all
the ALRMs, leaving nothing but his signature magic sigill.
