I fucked up. I wanted to see what kind of carpet it was and it had reacted explosively, trashing my room, and pushing itself against the ceiling and away from me. I had no idea it could do that! In fact, I'm pretty sure it shouldn't have. Except I fucked up. Well, to be fair, mom fucked up, dad, whoever he was and wherever he is, fucked up, and Terri probably fucked up a bit as well.

Terri just rushed in and looked worried and then concerned when he saw the carpet and then he said, or more like, yelled:

– "Why are you trying a carpet *indoors*?!"

Turns out I've been pretty stupid. As Terri told me: yes, experienced people can use carpets indoors, but they almost never do, because of the risk of damage. And *of course* the carpet shop had protective spells to make trying them out safe. And finally, I should not have been blasting magic at the carpet willy-nilly.

– "Wait— what? I'm not magic!  
– Of course you are. You *have* felt other carpets before, right?  
– Yeah, but—  
– And did you ever wonder why you were able to know things about them without being told?  
– That just means I must have read stuff before and remembered it. Or that I was looking at the display without thinking. I don't know! But I'm not magic everyone gets tested at school and I'm not."

That stumped him. He looked thoughtful and then asked:

– "Did you *want* to be a magician?  
– What? It's everyone's dream to be a magician. Well, every non-magician's dream. Why wouldn't you want to be able to make the universe yield?  
– I didn't ask *everyone*, I asked *you*. At the time, did you really want to be a magician? Or did you want something else?"

I pursued my lips. There's no way he could know this, and given his way of phrasing things he's probably just guessing at things but still. It's a bit creepy. Everyone gets tested for magic at the age of 10. Well, actually, people can be figured as magicians before, if they exhibit their abilities, or if their parents know and they push them forward. But for most kids, that time when they're 10 years old is when they get hopeful they'll have magic. Many are disappointed. Some are even more disappointed, because sometimes kids whose parents are magical and siblings are magical "luck out" or something and they don't get magic.

At the time I got into an argument with older kids who were using magic to bully younger ones and I got worked up and really pissed against magicians like that. And when I wasn't tested positive I was almost glad. But the disappointment came pretty quickly and that was sad. And now Terri is suggesting that I might have magic after all but repressed it somehow?

– "It's actually pretty common. Before you ask, the reason you're not tested again year after year, or that the test isn't more rigorous, is mostly good intentions wrapped up in politics: people who don't want magic are often better off not using it if they have it.  
– That doesn't make sense. If you don't train them, isn't the risk of something going wrong worse than if you do train them but they choose not to use it?  
– In theory, yes. But there have been several high-profile cases where people who didn't want magic were forced to train, and as a result either didn't listen and made stupid mistakes or…  
– …or they maimed themselves and other people attempting to get rid of the magic. I *had* heard of this, I didn't realise that was the reason."

He didn't say anything for a minute. Finally, he asked in a careful voice:

– "Did Caroline ever tell you who exactly your dad was?"

What? Why would Terri ask about my father? What does this have to do with anything?

– "N-not really. Mom told me his name was Ieli, and that he disappeared before I was born, but that I wasn't to resent him for that, and that's about it. Oh! I know they met in Orthanach, and moved here because he'd bought the the house for mom.  
– So you've never wondered about it? Researched about it?  
– Should I have? It's not like I missed him… or knew him… Is-was he someone important?  
– Ieli? Not really. He was a magician, though. And he was of the Morrigan Line.  
– Line? Like, a bloodline? There's plenty of Morrigans around, I know of at least two at school.  
– Yes, yes, the Morrigan family is wide and broad. But the Morrigan Line is special. They all descend from a single witch, you may have heard of her: Fahin Morrigan, more popularly known as Aléh.  
– …  
– …  
– I'm descended from ALÉH ?!  
– Well, to be precise, you're the *last known alive member* of the Morrigan Line."

And that's about when I passed out.

I wake up in my bed, the curtains are drawn but I can see the sky in-between. It's late, which means I've spent about six hours sleeping. What happened? I spend a little while remembering the events of the afternoon, before I hear something happening downstairs. Mom is yelling? This never happens. I strain to listen:

– "…I didn't tell her… …magic because… …happy… …safe.  
– I can understand that… …she needs… …learn to control it.  
– …don't want… …get hurt… …move away… …has friends here.  
– She nearly blew up her room just by *touching* a carpet! She *needs* to be taught… …be safe… …you know that.  
– Fine! But only… …you do… …about time, too.  
– …know I don't… …not anymore.  
– …exception, *or else*."

What? Mom *knew* I'm magic? And she didn't tell me? Also: why the fuck does *Terri* know about it? Why does he know about my ancestry? I thought he was just a weird boyfriend, not some kind of mystery figure who knows my past better than I do.

I jump out of bed, intent on asking those questions directly instead of angsting around, but my legs seem to have forgotten how to function properly so I just crash down and sprawl across the floor. 'the hell? I didn't realise I was that tired, I mean, I really shouldn't be; all I did today was… throw magic at a carpet. Oh. How can doing just *that* tire me to the point of disabling my legs?! This is screwed up. Terri, whatever or whoever he is, is right: I need to learn how to control this thing.

I hear footsteps coming up. Apparently my fall was more noisy than I thought. This is going to be embarassing, I can't even stand up, I can only just crawl over and try to prop myself alongside my bookshelf. Mom throws open the door, catching my foot and pushing it away violently.

– "Ouch-shit-hell— ooop sorry mom.  
– Are you alright? We heard something fall.  
– Yeah, uhm, that was me, my legs don't want to work."

Mom casts a worried look, and glances behind her. Terri steps in:

– "Can you feel them? Can you move your toes?" he kneeled down and poked my knee. My leg reacted and kicked him in the chin. I'm so relieved I forget to say sorry. Mom just *giggles*.  
– "I'm okay, I think. Just tired. Do you think it's the magic?  
– Maybe. And shock." He massages my tibia a bit before standing up. "Try now."

I stand, grabbing onto a shelf to steady myself. I'm still a bit wobbly. I sit down on my bed and stare at mom:

– "You *knew* I had magic.  
– I'm sorry—  
– You *knew* I had magic, you knew it could be dangerous, you knew I *wanted* to be a magician, you know I love carpets and magic and everything and NEVER SAID *ANYTHING*?  
– I just wanted you to be safe!" She looks hurt. I don't care.  
– "What if that had happened *elsewhere*? I could have— I could have— I could have *hurt* someone! Hurt a friend! And *what the fuck is the Morrigan Line*?!  
– Cindi! Language!  
– No! I— No! I want to know." I collapsed and started crying. "Who *am* I?" I asked in a small voice.
