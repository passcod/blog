## This year

In [the post that started this whole monthly blogging thing][10dec16], I
outlined three things I wanted to do this year:

 - Improve my accent.

   Hiring a speech therapist didn't work out, because (predictably) it turns
   out that 1) there's not many actually specialised in the particular narrow
   field of accent correction, 2) those that are are fully booked for the
   foreseeable future, and 3) none of them are near Whangarei _anyway_.

   But I've been speaking a lot more, to more people. I'm no extrovert, but I
   think I've been progressing nonetheless. I'll continue working at it. At
   some point I'd like to do some meetup and then conference speaking, too.

 - Improve my health.

   I've lost about 5 kg since the beginning of the year. More than that, I've
   built up some muscle mass and established healthier habits. I've changed
   jobs, going from a highly stressful place where I burned out several times,
   to a more rewarding _and_ more relaxing opportunity. I sleep better, in part
   because of more regular and longer cycles, and in part because I have
   improved my sleeping posture. There are other little things that add up. But
   it's looking up!

 - Improve my writing.

   Well, I've definitely done well here. Just in this blog, I have written more
   this year than every single previous year, _combined_. I've authored several
   pieces of fanfiction, and published three. Most importantly, I've really
   enjoyed myself. I write better and faster now, even though I don't think
   I'll ever be someone who can bang out a novel in a few months.
