## NZ.js

NZ.js was really good! One attendee made [a recap via tweets][nzjs-recap], and
[all the talks][nzjs-talks] are already up and available. If you only have a
little time, I recommend the opening keynote by @rockbot, the closing talk by
@prototypealex, but almost all the other talks were great too, of course.
Almost? Almost. There was definitely **one** that I didn't care for at all, and
maybe a couple others were merely _meh_. But overall? great stuff.

## Master Kylo

A bit stalled. I've got the material, and the inspiration is there, but the
time is lacking. Most probably going to miss the May 4th goal, but should have
something out by mid-year, I think.

## Fanfiction

This month, taking a bit of a break, and only keeping up with stories I follow.
