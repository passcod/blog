## NZ.js

NZ.js was really good! One attendee made [a recap via tweets][nzjs-recap], and
[all the talks][nzjs-talks] are already up and available. If you only have a
little time, I recommend the opening keynote by @rockbot, the closing talk by
@prototypealex, but almost all the other talks were great too, of course.
Almost? Almost. There was definitely **one** that I didn't care for at all, and
maybe a couple others were merely _meh_. But overall? great stuff.

## Master Kylo

A bit stalled. I've got the material, and the inspiration is there, but the
time is lacking. Most probably going to miss the May 4th goal, but should have
something out by mid-year, I think.

I [tweeted an (intentionally) blurry photo][mk-timeline] of a timeline I put up
on my whiteboard. That was a progress shot: its current state is quite a bit
more complete, but I also can't show it because ***spoilers***.

Black is what I'm using from Canon, boxed names are characters or organisations
I care about (or for context), and correspond to lines showing, by their
proximity, where people/orgs are in relation to others. Purple is the Alternate
Universe parts of my fic, the things that are not Canon. Yes, this fic is
multiple-points-of-departure.

You can't see it because it's so faint, but there's also dates indicated. That
busy middle bit before the vertical line going upwards is the period between 5
and 28 ABY. The leftmost of the board starts at 19 BBY, i.e. the end of Episode
III, and the rightmost lines end around 34 ABY, i.e. Episode VII. I left a bit
of space after that for the actual action of my fic. It's not to scale! There's
some areas that are very expanded, and some where five years take as many
centimetres. I only have so much space.

## Fanfiction

This month, taking a bit of a break, and only keeping up with stories I follow.
The ones listed below are not _all_ I follow, but those I started before
listing them in these Monthly Updates, and that I think deserve a mention.

- {Pokémon} [The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species).
- {Pokémon} [The Line](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line).

I managed to read a few new stories after all:

- {HP} [Soul Scars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923792/1/Soul-Scars).

  Seemed creepy but the author is awesome so I read anyway… it's actually very
  cute and an excellent exploration of the concept, written in 21 stories each
  following a character. Very much recommended, and a short enough read to
  actually be doable when otherwise busy. {64k words}

- {HP} [Safe Word is Devil's Snare](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8376331). This is lovely. Very NSFW. {96k words}
- {HP} [Misplaced Moony](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8376253). Okay well I guess I'm going to binge all of ShayaLonnie's stuff. Ongoing. {64k words atow}
- {HP} [Amid the Chaos](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8375905). I really need to transfer my FFN skin over to AO3. {22k words atow}
- {HP} [Storm of Yesterday](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352). Thank you for the tears, wanker! {130k words}
- {HP} [The Reclamation of Black Magic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8374798). I love rituals and good!Blacks. {105k words atow}
- {HP} [Arx Domus Nigrae](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10506441/1/Arx-Domus-Nigrae). Guess who this was recommended by. {113k words atow}
- {HP} [Nihil est ab Omni Parte Beatum](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5733457). The Latin titles really has it. {108k words}
- {SW} [Tomorrow (there'll be more of us)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5648131). Perfect. {3k words}
