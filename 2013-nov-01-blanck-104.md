I get disoriented by a strange smell while walking home, before remembering this is summer and the orange trees are flowering. It's like I've walked right back into Year 8 while Mom was still baking. We had cupboards full of spices and exotic flavours, three different kinds of flour, a myriad of sugars, and utensils of various shape and use. Afternoons were fun and the house constantly scented of sweets and cakes and jams. It was fun.

We still have the utensils.

I walk by myself, making sure to keep an even distance to both people in front of me and people behind. It shouldn't matter anyway, not anymore, but I picked the habit when it did and it feels unsafe not to. A bit like stepping only on unbroken pavement, or only on black squares, or only on a line; meaningless, irrational habits. The group behind me turns into a street. I stop, waiting for the group in front to pick up enough distance so I can feel safe again.

I take my phone out, and pretend to be doing something important, answering some urgent communication, so people don't stare at the girl stopped in the middle of the path doing nothing. I think I feel people stare anyway. I hear a laugh, and my heart beats up in my chest; it takes me a minute to convince myself that wasn't someone laughing at me, how could they, I'm doing something with my phone, people don't laugh at people who do that, oh my god they know I'm faking it I'm so doomed calm down calm down.

I think I can feel the stares intensifying. As if that was possible. I give up on trying to see beind me with the screen of my phone off without looking suspicious, and start forward again. I cannot see any students in front of me, and a nervous peek backwards indicate none are behind either. I relax just as much as I cringe: I must have let some pass me while I was pretending to not do nothing, making it all moot.

The smell is still there, even though the orange trees are far behind. Perhaps the wind is carrying it over today. Perhaps it's all in my mind. Phantom smells would be the last thing I need, but if they're as pleasant as this, I'm not going to complain.

The bus is fashionably late.

That particular never has and never will arrive on time, because the bus tables predicting its movements haven't changed since they remade the road after an apartment block fell down in Year 5. I understood why only much later: the road wasn't cleared and moved by the city, who would rather have bypassed the area — a shankytown of sorts — it was moved by its residents, or rather its resident warlord's minions.

The city ignored the entire incident. The bus company also did. As far as they're concerned, nothing changed, so buses still take the route, disappearing from their radar for a moment while they drive along a road nobody wishes to concede exists. And the bus is late.

Most regulars have learned to add five minutes to the allocated time. A few, plus the irregulars and one-time passengers, look collectively worried, angry, hungry, desperate, happy to be able to kiss their sweetheart longer, about to murder someone, completely stoned, bored, unhappy, stressed, frantic, and the hightened versions of all the emotions one finds in a city.

I sit three places from the back. Old school habits again, from before I undertook to take the city bus instead of the student one. Three places from the back is just far enough from the backseat bullies and not too close from the middle inverted seats where the cool kids hang out. Sometimes I sat at the front, to put myself under the protective gaze of the driver, although retaliation afterwards was worse, until a kid got stuffed into the overhead racks without the driver doing anything. She simply pretended they didn't exist.

At the kid's bus stop that day, she waited for him to go down, then shrugged as he didn't and went on. It took him four blocks to extirpate himself, not making eye contact with anyone, even falling halfway, his backpack cushioning the shock with a sad little crunch. He's been using the same broken ruler in math ever since.

I know these are small stories. In my college alone, I must be one of the least bullied, among all the weakling population of Tamara High. And given the stories I read and the news and the tweets and the posters and the everything else that's going on to get people to report bullying — it only very minorly helps, but I hear it helps, somewhat, just not me — it must be much bigger outside.

Sometimes I wonder if it would be better or worse in a private school. Or better or worse in a public school in a bad neighbourhood. Or better or worse in a rural school. I wonder a lot and research little on the subject because I do not want to see that I either have it bad or just how good I have it compared to the guys down three blocks and one sideways.

And what good does it do to wonder? I'm not going to move, I'm in my last year so there's not much point. We couldn't anyway. My future doesn't even extend out of high school if I don't get a scholarship, and there's no way I'm getting one because I've tried so hard for so long to be invisible, to not make waves, to be sure to always be average in marks and everything. I shot myself in the foot trying to get away from the cannon fire.
