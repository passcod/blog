<h2>01: 0.00</h2>
<p>S: Hello and welcome aboard the intergalactic expressed a wild  route through
time and space. Today is a beginner’s guide written by Davey Wreden. So, what
kinda game’s gonna fuck you up? The beginners’ guide… that’s what.</p>
<p>[intro song]</p>
<p>S: So before we talk anymore about that game, cause we talked about it a bit
already. I’ll introduce your crew… there’s me, Saf. I’m joined by Canti.</p>
<p>C: Hello!</p>
<p>S: And also by Alex</p>
<p>A: Hullo</p>
<p>S: Who has very offset tones.</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>S: So what is the beginner’s guide? Canti, you’re the one that introduced us to
it, so.</p>
<p>C: It’s a narra— a fictional documentary about video games and Davey Wreden’s
made it, he’s the writer of A Stanley Parable. It’s great.</p>
<p>S: It is definitely something.</p>
<p>S: It is good to know that Davey Wreden’s made it, because he’s also the
character— one one the characters— in the game.</p>
<p>C: I mean it could be a different Davey.</p>
<p>S: It could be a different Davey, he does never say his last name, but also
when you’re a guy playing a Davey and you’re a Davey…</p>
<p>C: You kind of assume it’s the same Davey.</p>
<p>C: Which is kind of the whole point, isn’t it.</p>
<p>S: Yeah.</p>
<p>C: Hmm.</p>
<p>A: How much can we say about the game in general, like are we saying straight
up, now…</p>
<p>C: Spoilers Alert?</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>All: Oh yeah.</p>
<p>C: Oh yeah, shittonne of spoilers.</p>
<p>S: Absolutely.</p>
<p>S: Well it is a little impossible to talk about this game without spoiling the
game</p>
<p>C: We could try to talk about it, like for a little bit, just about the
concept, without spoilers, or we could just go straight into it.</p>
<p>S: Nah, it’s pretty hard to speak on the game without spoiling anything so I
would advise if you haven’t played this game yet, go play it now and then come
back and listen to this afterwards, because we will be spoiling it. It is very
hard to talk about this game without spoiling it at all.</p>
<p>A: Right now we’re like train tracks.</p>
<p>A: And.</p>
<p>S: Yeah, you can’t stop us.</p>
<p>A: And you’re like, lying on the tracks.</p>
<p>A: And if we hit you.</p>
<p>S: You die?</p>
<p>A: Yeah. I mean.</p>
<p>A: It was never… you’ll never get to experience this game in the same way.</p>
<p>S: Yeah.</p>
<p>A: And also it will kill you.</p>
<p>S: Also that.</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>S: So. What do we think about this game? Canti what do you want to say?</p>
<p>C: All I was just gonna say that the video that put me onto the beginner’s
guide was theoretically a review but they didn’t wanna spoil it, so it was
about five minutes of a man talking straight to camera about how it made him
feel feelings.</p>
<p>But he couldn’t be specific about what the feelings were, cause he couldn’t
spoil it, so was just five minutes of “this game made me feel feelings”, which
is really all you need to know. If you haven’t played the beginner’s guide it
will make you feel feelings, go feel those feelings now before you listen to us
feel those feelings.</p>
<p>S: So, yes, spoiler warning. What do we think about this game?</p>
<p>S: I am going to talk through it, because I’m already talking. Um.</p>
<p>C: I really liked that it made me feel complicated and weird feelings and.</p>
<p>C: I like a good narrative that can twist my emotions and that a way that it
makes me hate myself a little bit.</p>
<p>A: It gave me a headache.</p>
<p>C: Yeah I’m felt the same.</p>
<p>A: Like, I loved it, don’t get me wrong, but.</p>
<p>A: I— straight after I played it I just went and layed down, for a little bit.</p>
<p>C: [laughter]</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>A: It was just— it was this realy weird experience. I had this things where I
was just hating playing it just cause it made me feel awful. [chuckle] Um.</p>
<p>A: Like it was beautiful, really really well done but, the feelings that it
creates are so negative, and like that’s part of the power of it. And I was
just really overwhelmed by how, umm, awful it was.</p>
<p>C: It kinda builds up that feeling of awe, and then it completely twists the
feeling into disgust.</p>
<p>A: Yeah. Yeah exactly.</p>
<p>A: Yeah, you’re really, it really builds you up to let you down.</p>
<p>S: Yeah it does. Canti what did you think about this game.</p>
<p>C: Um I’m gonna— basically the same stuff that you said but in the context of
having played it twice, because I came out the two times feeling very different
about it. The first time I played it, you know, I was completely blind to
everything that Davey is saying, so it really feels like having the</p>
<h2>02: 4.48</h2>
<p>C: The whole thing pulled at underneath you. Cause you’ve got these games based
on what the game is giving you. And you don’t question it, you know, when the
game is giving it, you’re not gonna question it till you really have to. So I
completely bought into it. And then, as you— and so— I was <em>so</em> worried for
Coda for most of the game, exactly like Davey was telling me to be, the part
where you beat the machine, like, I was horrified, I wasso scared of what Coda
was going to do.</p>
<p>C: And um, the second time through, when you know what’s going on, it just made
me feel so sad for Davey. Because his life is so terrible, and everything that
he’s doing is so terrible, and you just want him to realise it.</p>
<p>C: So um. I guess— I forgot what the question was; how did the game make you
feel? And me answer is… [pause] I don’t know! It touched on these feelings
about creating and what it means to create something and give it to something
else, that nothing else has ever made me think about or feel before. And I
think that’s really incredible.</p>
<p>A: Mm.</p>
<p>S: Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>C: I mean I think the stuff— the stuff that it says is something anybody who
has created anything can sympathise with, but it’s not something that you
actually think about as being an actual <em>thing</em>. It’s something you feel, but
it’s not something you think that people are actually going to talk about. So
when you realise, that this is what the game is saying… that was a pretty big
moment.</p>
<p>S: Yeah. I definitely agree.</p>
<p>C: I mean, here’s something I’d like to say about the beginner’s guide. THis is
a weird one, but um. The first time I played it, I was in Melbourne. I was only
in Melbourne for two days. I’d only gone to Melbourne because I was meeting up
with family, and we were gonna see the Matilda musical that night.</p>
<p>C: So I had a day, where I was stuck in— stuck in the center of Melbourne. I
wasn’t doing anything for another five hours. And it was too rainy to go
outside. So I was lying in bed, playing this game, and when I think back on it,
from that experience— I mean, Matilda is a great musical, don’t get me wrong,
but everything I remember about that day was The Beginners’ Guide.</p>
<p>C: It’s the— I did some pretty incredible stuff that day, and the <em>only</em> thing
that stuck with me was that experience of playing TBG.</p>
<p>A: I feel like it would be a pretty weird sort of experience, to go playing TBG
and then go, and seeing Matilda the musical.</p>
<p>C: We were— and basically we went out to dinner before we went to see the
musical, so I was trying to explain the beginner’s guide to my mom, who does
<em>not</em> play video games, and my brother, who does, but not these sorts of video
games, and I just wanted so desperately to talk about it, and they just wanted
to eat burgers.</p>
<p>A: I can just imagine you crying into your burger— was it a cheeseburger?</p>
<p>C: Possibly, that sounds like me. We got zucchini fries,</p>
<p>A: Ooh. Oooh, you went to that place.</p>
<p>C: What— Grilled…</p>
<p>A: Maybe. Maybe. I had zucchini fries last time I was in Melbourne, and I had a
very good time. THey were very salty, though.</p>
<p>S: You know, I genuinely don’t remember when I first started playing it. I
think you were telling me about it. I think— yeah.</p>
<p>C: I’m pretty sure— I mean, I’m sure ppl had told you before but I really got
onto you</p>
<p>S: Yeah, and I rememebr at PAX last year. Like there were a few panels, and
they, mentioned the beginnners guide in many of them, but they were like, this
is relevant to what we’re talking about, but we can’t really talk about it.</p>
<p>S: And I was like, how can you <em>not</em> talk about this game at all, and not spoil
it, and how is it relevant to all of these things? And, because you had talked
about it to me so much, like “you have to play this game”, and then all of
these other people were like, “this game is really good”, so I was like okay,
I’m going to finally play this game.</p>
<p>S: And I did, and it did. It made me feel real awful, in a way that made me
feel real good. Cause— I’m not— Like media kinda generally tries to make you
feel better about yourself. Like especially the [inaudible] games, they try to
make you feel like a Good Person.</p>
<p>S: And this game is like. No. You’re a terrible person, think about what you’re
doing. And I really liked that.</p>
<p>C: Oh I like that in games. That’s why I keep playing [inaudible]</p>
<p>A: It was— It made me feel really awful for a moment and then you step back for
a moment and you’re like, “whoa, it’s <em>amazing</em> that I feel <em>so terrible</em>!”</p>
<p>All: Yeah! Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>C: Especially again, sorry, but on a replay, when Davey’s like “Oh, but you
can’t possibly climb up these stairs, let me just skip you to the end of the
stairs”. And the first time through it’s like “oh, thanks Davey!” cause I was
very oblivious to what was going on, and the second time I was like “Davey,
maybe I’m just not meant to climbs those stairs, DAvey maybe it’s just okay how
it is.”</p>
<p>S: The first time I did it, I did the maze, and I also climbed out the stairs
myself, I was like, “screw you, Davey, I’m gonna do it cause I can, because
Coda built it like that.” and then the second time I was like, “you know, I’ve
already played, so, help me for a second.”</p>
<p>[laughter]</p>
<p>S: It reminds me of Spec Ops. You haven’t played, Canti, right?</p>
<p>C: No, I keep hearing about it, but I haven’t played.</p>
<p>S: Yeah. It has— it reminded me a little bit of SpecOps, not in an gameplay
way, cause they’re very different games, but the feelings they’re trying to
evoke are both very similar. I mean SPecOps has been talked to death, because
of it. Like people know, what that game is, because that is the game’s point,
and</p>
<h2>03: 10:33</h2>
<p>S: I gotta say [inaudible] the better, because when you play video games you’re
used to committing violence, and you know it, like you know this isn’t real
violence.</p>
<p>S: Like I’m committing violence and with guns and that’s what the game is
about. It’s kinda fun to shoot things. In a game. It’s why I play Halo.</p>
<p>S: And then the beginner’s guide comes along and then there’s… you know,
there’s different kinds of violence.</p>
<p>C: Ooh yeah.</p>
<p>S: These are the kind of things you don’t think about when you’re playing
games, like, you don’t get to be an awful person and have like repurcussions,
because when you have a game like Mass Effect or Dragon Age where you have the
kind of binary morality system, whether or not you play as a good person or a
bad person, the game wants to reward you, whatever you do.</p>
<p>S: So you never get punished. If you’re a bad person, you get your rewards: you
get stronger, you get paid more, or whatever. Like, peopple die, sure, but it’s
a game, it’s not actually a person, and in <em>this</em> game, because you get the
story of Davey through Davey, you don’t— while you’re playing it, you start to
not really know whether or not it’s actually fictional, or if you’re playing a
real, a real scenario, that’s been put into a fictional situation as well.</p>
<p>S: Um. Which you find, when you go on the Steam forum, then you see these
people like “we have to find Coda”.</p>
<p>C: First time I looked all the comments were like “Is it just me, or is it kind
of unethical to be profitting off Coda’s game like this. I hope Davey is giving
Coda some money.”</p>
<p>S: Yeah, I saw some posts were like “Is is not unethical for us to be playing
this game and get achievments?” like, you idiot, this game is fake. It’s— it’s
hard to like— when I first finished the game I was like, “Is… Coda… real?”
like,</p>
<p>A: Yeah.</p>
<p>S: is this real, I don’t actually know if it’s a real experience. And then,
then I talked to you and then I googled it, and I was like, okay, yeah, it’s
not real it’s an experience but it could have been based off stuff that we
don’t know about, or on feelings at least, and, even if it’s not, it still
feels very real.</p>
<p>A: It feels so real. You go out of the game feeling like this is a huge crime
against all that is moral, and you take a step back, and you go “oh yeah, this
is, this is like an artpiece”</p>
<p>C: Yeah</p>
<p>A: It’s not necessarily based on, well, it might be based on, but I think it’s
safe to assume that, at the very least the games that we played weren’t.</p>
<p>C: Yeah, and I mean, you gotta remember that R, whoever R is, I think that R
was his room-mate? Or his flatmate? I read that somewhere. In the credits,
where the credits say it’s “For R.”</p>
<p>S: I rememebr, I read an article by someone, who was like, “I may have been R.”
And I was like, “ooh, that’s a weird place to be in.” I mean, the fact they
didn’t <em>know</em> means it probably wasn’t them.</p>
<p>C: Nah, I feel like R probably knows.</p>
<p>S: Yeah.</p>
<p>C: That thing you were saying before, about how, ummm, I forget exactly what
you are saying that it made me think of this discussion I was reading about how
the more familiar you are with game design, and like set design, the more ah,
relatable story is, but be transparent that that conceit is because anybody who
knows anything about game design knows that the sort of things that Coda is
doing is really freaking hard to do.</p>
<p>S: Yeah, he made these games in like, a month, and you’re like, “No.”</p>
<p>C: So I’m glad that— that seems believable to me because I— I like— I didn’t
think it was, I don’t think any point I thought it was real. But I— I liked
being able to immerse myself into that whole… conceit.</p>
<p>S: Yeah when I first played it I had a lot less knowledge on game design, then.
Which. game building and stuff, and yeah, but on my replay I was like, there’s
no way, like, I would believe now that like, this one guy was building new
amazing environments, in like a month or something, and they look like, and is
so perfect and bug free and everything, like no, that’s not— that’s not
believable.</p>
<p>C: And all— the level that looks like it’s got real people in it. And whole
conversations.</p>
<p>S: Yeah yeah I mean— all of it’s obviously original assets. Like it’s still a
smallish game, but</p>
<p>C: Yeah.</p>
<p>S: But, I think, people who don’t play, or who don’t design games, who be more
immersed into this game, like emotionally, because they wouldbe more invested,
than people who’d be like, analysing the game design.</p>
<p>C: Yeah. Year.</p>
<p>A: I mean I think the moment that you start to overthink, in a way, is when
you— I’m getting what’s wrong.</p>
<p>C: Yeah.</p>
<p>A: It’s like with anything, I think, if you can’t enjoy something— like
obviously there’s enjoyment in analysing games, but when you consume it, you
have to <em>consume</em> it, and so.</p>
<p>S: I think this game benefits from ah, as well, I mean they want us to come—
You can’t help analysing— A lot of games falter for me becasue I analyse the
game design when I play it, um, but this game, worked well for that. The first
time I played, because, I was over-analysising it in the wrong direction. I was
analysing Coda.</p>
<p>C: Yeah yeah exactly like you’re being lead to do.</p>
<p>S: And the words and everything, why was I, I was going very
analysisy, and like what does this mean, is Davey telling me the truth, blah
blah, and then, erm later on you realize that Davey has lied about a lot of
these, about the games that he’s designed, and he changed game meaning like
this, and it gets to this point where it loops, and then it ends, and it has to
end, and that’s the point of this, this whole level, is that it ends. You can’t
stay here forever. And then you find out at the end of the game that that looped
forever, and you can’t end it, so you <em>could</em> stay there forever, and keep
playing. And it completely changes the meaning of the level, of what it even
meant to begin with.</p>

<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah yeah that’s all.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah you’re right you’re me.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
It.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Also poly largely I love okay way okay we’re gonna joyously report which I love joy and one of my design things within the game and when their choice but it’s gone because of choice in the game and then pull the joys of playing the game sending us bagels because it was like you have a choice to stop playing the game I think no I don’t want.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Something they said about the game itself like you don’t know where anything can make sure to stop doing this and that on-again.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Or off-again.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I mean you can just put this came down and shit.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
In the game is on again now.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
So.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I think it’s only like the creators a candid.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You always have a choice even but then again you can make that choice yeah it’s hard to stop running game but it wasn’t as target while I don’t easily got up and put it in the pot game is that you can stop playing and that’s your choice to stop.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
In part this violence because you could end up on and I think they’re gonna guide kind does as well their point in the game we realize it eating bad and you can have a choice you know I don’t want to keep being partners emotional pain I am feeling what I want is down in the house anymore and obviously a play and you know I don’t know what number the better game.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
But you story.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Exactly but it is a point and like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Some games that like.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You don’t.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Actually into playing more and I think this thing you know is a linear story it has that choice built into it that.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You could have.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Chosen when the games are also like when you get that label.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And the building was a lazy I get there and is that like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Do you make your way across the globe are you gonna make a choice then to be like it was going.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
My.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Which is what quote originally Janet.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Okay urge linking then no he’s not gonna do anything but more I need you to go in your life I didn’t make that mistake like open the fictional well then I come in the state I keep going or when I did not realize they were right.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Arm and that’s part of what makes you feel so bad later on is that you did expressway I did like when you get that final game you realize that things are alright.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I think about it is that you can tell that things.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Aren’t right.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Tom O..</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Why.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Your.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Answer you keep going because you like and you know why now right and.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I know that a lot of water but I yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I think that when you’re gone.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah you like holy shit I’m taken into Bosnia.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I I’m I’m I’m not a huge fan of the your choice is to stop playing because my choice is very rarely going to be to stop playing because I want to see where it goes.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
So I don’t know I understand that the game might be presenting stop playing is a choice.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
No one thinks no I don’t want nothing but not.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Knowing what I’m saying stop playing games don’t do that anymore I think it’s interesting when games have that as.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
A choice.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I’m gonna build on purpose they don’t building and building is open thing but part of the game is that.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You don’t get that ash game and this game is about nuclear Julianne’s where they do put you into places where you got your bad about what do I like the real thing games like trains out like it does put you in a bad situation mentally emotionally when all it’s fictional oreo and.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It kind of does.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Bring up that bag that you the game or game.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Mr had that.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
So yeah yeah I mean.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I agree little mobile Gerald yeah buying but am I generally if you feel like your show doing something in real.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
The instructor.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah things actually.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Games narratives.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You know what you mean.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And that’s part of what drives the game is that you made the choice to get what might not be our.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
It would make a difference.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I at it.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
They will how did.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
To.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Right in the game.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Strap O..</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
At this point.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
But I would think that.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
They want.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I think it’ll be interesting and long and like out of things that’s not going to make people.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
But I’m.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I mean.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
That’s probably is like it was your choice and you.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You do need very well and I’m back and.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
So are.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You saying you are implicit in what happened which is why it is like I say that you are implicit in what happens because you made the choice to actively keep playing the game even though we were never gonna choose any other choice because of the game yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
That’s why it’s bad might hurt.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
The game becomes your child out of the narrow not psychic.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I’m not saying that’s what you’re.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Not is there a way.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And that’s what we’re trying to you know.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I mean there are people who could have stopped you may stop playing this game list of things I’m bands of the encoders there was a guy making games that they.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
So begins all.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You get a story which is.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Maybe blissful ignorant yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Mostly parents there.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Feeling well because that was a real wholesome story.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You should love and friendship.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
They do the real thing.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
This is something that I completely missed the first time which is probably my fault being oblivious because I don’t think it’s Sausal.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
But what I completely missed the first time is that the whole level in the tower is curd is coda trying to make you stop why Hank.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah breaks every puzzle there is there to stop you from getting to the top of the tower it’s like Carter is giving Davina five chances to stop making the wrong decision.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And so I could see if so I can kind of see what Alex was saying about how the game could actually give you the choice.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Mostly I think basing early appreciate on replayed effects at the choice to not climb to the top of the tower and how different would that make the game but again that you’re also you’re not Davey but you are seeing you all sort of playing from Davies perspective in search of miss out on that revelation for Davy.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Revelation forgiven value of revelation the dude is pretty of nothing else.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Early lead.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Suffer.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
From.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Any given point.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Year.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And you know I agree absolutely out of the fact that like it is knowing that he is lying in what.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Did you know.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
What is life just about what do you watch the movie.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
That like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
If you made a documentary mocking married there I’d.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
It will not fail.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You will not underlings and that’s why games.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
What I’m not health not going out.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I think like.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
It’s interesting you’re right about like that’s how it seems like is trying to stop buying but then there is something in me in.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Well the point is early in the year Carto wants David to stop messing around with these games and the only way to get to the top of the tower is to mess around with all the games.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Right writers really saying it stopped now and will be okay or what you’re doing and you’re going to have to find out how this is make.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
We feel.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah I don’t think.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
That I’m.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Sorry I keep interrupting everybody no actually I was thinking about how I looked nice in the woods.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
But do you one choice from night in the woods the one part or not the woods that is still with me the hardest choice in the game.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Is the bit where Maggie is staring into a mirror and you have to find something about her to criticize.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
That’s the one thing that sticks in my head because you have to say something meet you have to either tell it sees ugly or you got a horrible Kreisel something and the rest that I was lovely but that moment when you had to do that.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Is the one thing that really stuck with me.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And yelling at me.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Because it it comes on there are and she stands if you look in the mirror and Hugh my.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Earlier you can.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You picking up her well you like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I work here or better I deliberately.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah you bet things we can do all things that remind.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It is always open the ending in the early.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah unfortunate when.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Character and.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Later in direct sometimes and.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
One is as a player you owe but character has control over their own personal feelings if you are any.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
In a game where you are.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I care O..</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I’m.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I care.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Okay thank me it’s usually.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Are.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Run okay.</p>
<h2>05: 28:31</h2>
<p>Speaker 1:
No I I don’t know what is it out completely.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You don’t have that freedom.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Then you might if you’re earning.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Unless this one.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You is this one right down.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You just you just have the potential to we need to be tied to the.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Not much luck was.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Okay yeah it’s it’s good at Powell and it’s how.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
It’s just like you are in a position on.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah well in your car ends and it’s also when you can tell when a game as good.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I didn’t get a writer such are lighter on it you know they don’t you know and.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Is that they can line up the players.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Goals.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And aspirations and feelings with the character Blair’s goals and aspirations but also were not making them lined up at the right times like you know in the woods when you don’t want to be mean to me you have to be because that’s what she is your member that you you’re really all about it and this game.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
You’re a little thing but if you’re implying is just you and so your goals I wanted us Legnago are what works really well because you know if I think me and your goals and then one day he wants you know because.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
You’re playing a game and it and it became.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
No one going to disarm talk about this for ten minutes because I was thinking about this when I replayed transistor recently as well.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
All you know trends at the thing with transistor is that you your character is silent you’ve got the narrator is basically a boyfriend you know it’s the whole game and keeps giving advice on what to do and the first time through it’s very easy to think that.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Everything that he sang in everything that is talking about is how your character feels as well but there’s a couple of points which she gets to test which he gets ways of expressing herself which she turned out to be quite different.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Then what you think and at the end she make some decisions that you wouldn’t have expected her to make and the whole point of it is that.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You’ll being what you’re really doing is being presented her character from the transistors perspective and she’s actually got a whole lot going on that you’re not gonna see unless you really think.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
So the whole thing of presenting inspected and saying this is your character’s perspective.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
But is that the right one is actually what’s going on is that.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
This car this perspective.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
There’s a very well known piece of interactive fiction this is a big data about nothing telling stuff to fly her monitor if you got a chance and you probably shouldn’t because it’s not great but it’s gold Ranma sees and it still playing as a teenage boy whose life is shit because he’s kind of a shit head.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And you place a couple of scenes in his day and basically you’ll be in a situation where he should actually be axed something good might happen to him but no matter what you type.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You’ll just be like I can’t do that I’m I’m a mess I’m anxious I’m I’m a trash bag because he is.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And he doesn’t do anything it happens like six times you know do you get him to help keep being bullied you get in to kiss the girl and about what you say here refuses to do it because that’s just not something he could do.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It’s good fascinating experience but it’s a very good portrayal of what it feels like to be an anxious you detained.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah it’s going back when.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I’m set mentioned are.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
About right.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah game reserves whom.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Trying to and science.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Are.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Desires and feelings that.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Okay.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
On.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
What that character.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
And that just makes you think you are doesn’t dragon virtually Wohnung yeah I’ve been doing a little string thing and it’s.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
So it difficult sometimes to.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Motivates I guess I’m just amazed me.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Game writers can lead to a wine those two things sometimes in the bank inserted under the right.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Why is.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
To.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Hello in metro.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
What why no.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Need a campaign I’m waiting maybe that’s actually not what they’re.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah doesn’t.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You bet it such that on that show how wide and moves.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
On.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
If you’re not some amazing.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
On the spot think that implants.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You have to be some degree when you are reading it you want it.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Is it your characters you don’t you tell me.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You can tell I don’t bump bump up.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And yeah yeah but you know them they’re going as well that you is eyeing that remark and then you are doing and how they walk me out when you go in there to try and plan for as many of us and and I mean I think guns I mean well if I could change in data like right are you not to throw them away Michael.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You know like.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I really think that you can go lying errors on anything now.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yet so I will I will do you gonna be damning to end date.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Are those dowels RPG because I just almost right here senator dean did you.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah yeah I know it and they can be really hard to align.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
The players goals.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Her elder where a lot of and no and that’s one of the strong points are they gonna guide because I think it doesn’t really give you our front office just you playing.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Thirty something and no so.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You out you are the audience.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Davy asked her.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Marriage.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
The prisons.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah it’s not you know.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
We’re gonna but he.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I am not easy what he wants from you inwards here too are these games.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
And what you are you start.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
And you.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You’re okay I don’t quite know I guess silence it.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
In the end you get to that begin.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Where it’s too late kind of like if you like it too late to stop playing.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
And you’re just like this isn’t what I want to do.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
But Dany still owe.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Wants you to.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
By the end you’re sort of realize that all Davy really what sees the usual hi Kim.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
If I fail.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
All in.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Also we will be seeing.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
More.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
If you start IE.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
And yeah there are.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
A zillion why.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
By now Blair under character either it’s also likely because you know where ward down our clan and the game is only do this thing else does it was are they looking Mary the docking area.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Well.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
As well that you.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
You know that you’re not married so I can see what is going on explorer as much as I can while I’m interacting with a gazillion during the docking area begins one and we will work so we are not at work.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I don’t expect to be.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Me either unique to being made to feel like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
You know that’s.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
One of the bad guys.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
It really really just burns you out and.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
What are your look.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I think what.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
We’re looking for the.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah I don’t usually analyst and it’s.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
So we’re going I want to go out.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You weren’t really too just like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Call all.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I think the young lions and claims and.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Also.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
We.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Okay out one one other thing I wonder about OEM finish this was Carter and the international court of being a woman potentially.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
All countries I nearly a woman this is my favorite.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah I saw it again along the lake when you’re playing the games I’m.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
When you’re playing card games those cars player character the business itself particularly I’m.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
You always arrest was a woman and when you.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Siva present at my present just crying there whimpering in the only real human that you see in the entire day.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
And so our I mean it’s also occurs almost all the time I was in the garden of Eden and evenings just shook her head.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I I’m pro anything that makes a bee seem less having said that I don’t want to sit on Davy endlessly the most heartbreaking part of the game for me is still.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Davies revelation that I think I might have done something stupid because I don’t like my yeah when you don’t my favorite line in the game.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Warns and when you think that.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
He.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Only liked her I will he actually hurt.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
How do I not realizing.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Okay.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Yeah I do it like in the subway does that Davy Jones as you grow up you don’t you’re very set quite an interesting and a game like seeing someone do such or opening and then actually but now that you like you know I.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
I shouldn’t design better it’s too late to fix it now but I’m still gonna think myself as I am and I think that’s a really.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Well.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
In games and stories and you know we could you just.</p>
<p>Speaker 1:
Don’t you know I think it is important that opens for a bad person and I need.</p>

<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah if you want to do an episode about sad that dad’s.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I mean for.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
One thing.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I think we got stuck if we’re talking about friends who really dislike the epilogue enough I find the it looks a little.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I’m not sure how I feel about the.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
We need the whole sequence in the train studying this is.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah right exactly I think it exists it just.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah me tear and then it certainly by surprise when I was playing it yeah awakes.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I don’t wanna say feels I need Sir I think.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Itself where.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You can tell us everything in our Sabbath on is there but yeah I think.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
After the tower you just have no.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Very overwhelmed with a shot then it just.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It’s going.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Winds down there we always had it when that happens I hate okay this is the thing is I hate lawyers.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
How I hate complete why don’t you mean yeah nothin enjoyed a movie I hate it when you know I hate that I hate it I hate it when you don’t give me pleasure it it was really bad that I love and gaming or books or movies or whatever and they make you feel real old and I can’t leave you with that feeling on and you’ll find if you’re reading you might hear books you’ll find that feeling in the in the niggers.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
And forward.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I liked it.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
When I read that one day aren’t but.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
That is why you need like it won’t make sense well Darden you get babies carries a wishing there and you get a bit like condoms Martin again but I also hate it because I don’t want that I want the game to you know me you’re like shit and is leading me.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
How does the game and before it goes to the epilogue.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
What what’s I mean it it’s the whole sequence when you’re in like the museum of messages girls like.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I am playing what you wear.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Any comes back again and says my god Becky not it lower.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:

<p>Speaker 0:
The other thing is that I’m not alone and so it.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah the epilogue ins with him.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Going in thinking ill putting going away for a bit on that one.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
I think it might be leaves twice iconic sleeve remember which tells you something about how it current sound.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Yeah I think is the breakdown and then in the epilogue see slightly more put together that yeah I.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Like a little bit I don’t we just let loose yeah yeah really belong remember so little.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
I think it speaks to.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Our member that inside of you walking into the aisle the laser that’s meant to kill apply only yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:

<p>Speaker 2:
I feel like I need to jump on you tube and rewatch the apple of just sort of talk saying anything else uses it publicly.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
There’s nothing wrong with that yields like it makes it walking the game.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
But there is no name tries not sure do not want you know game but I mean at the end of the matter so much if you were in Bangalore and experience.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
You know this morning I don’t think I don’t want.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:

<p>Speaker 2:
I found the dialogue from the outlook I found on the wiki and yeah Araks.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
It’s it’s sort of bringing out a whole lot of the themes are making them really explicit nature.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Near.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Like the dialogue is more more more more laughable craze more people telling me that I’m good it’s like a disease.</p>
<p>Speaker 0:
Yeah I know that’s exactly maybe I won’t.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Maybe if Michael you just like making prison games I wouldn’t tell people he was depressed.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
A if I knew my life depend on finding something other than validation to be driven on what would that even be the sort of not being driven by validation in.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:
Unthinkable.</p>
<p>Speaker 2:

<p>Speaker 0:
Near.</p>
