## The transcript

Good morning, afternoon, or evening, and welcome to Queerly There! Y'all voted
for today's topic on Twitter, and I'm so glad you did. Because this is one of
my absolutely favorite things to rant about. We're going to talk about
heteronormativity at Hogwarts.

[intro song]

Now, this episode is broken into two parts and both contain content warnings
for mentions of pedophilia and rape. Not in any great detail, I just thought I
should warn you ahead of time.

And to be more accurate, I'm going to be talking about heteronormativity in the
wider Harry potter universe, but I said normativity at Hogwarts because I enjoy
the assonance better.

Obviously, the episode contains spoilers for the Harry potter films and books.

Let's get some definitions out of the way first:

Heteronormativity: a term coined by Michael Warner in 1991, refers to prevalent
and invisible norms surrounding heterosexuality. Basically, it's the assumption
of monogamous straight relationships between cisgender men and women are the
only way to be. Or, at least, the default setting and anything else is Other.

It ties innately with cisnormativity which is the assumption that everyone is
cisgender and that men and women have natural roles. Those that fall outside of
these standard roles and relationships are ignored and socially devalued.

Harry Potter is a series of books and movies that's mostly set in the nineties.

I'm going to work on the assumption that if you're listening to this you at
least know the basics of the plot through cultural osmosis if nothing else.
Because we've got a lot of stuff to get through.

Let's start at the beginning.

Dumbledore: gay wizarding icon of a generation, Headmaster of Hogwarts, You
probably know where I'm going with this.

In 2007, JK Rowling revealed that Albus Dumbledore was gay but was criticized
for not making it explicit in the text.

We get some hints that — you could call them that — but nothing that you'd
notice if you weren't going through it with a fine tooth comb like yours truly.
In Philosopher Stone, the very first description of Dumbledore says that he's
wearing high heeled buckle boots and a purple cloak.

While undeniably fabulous, obviously, wearing purple and heels doesn't make you
gay. His outfit does fall outside the Muggle gender norms but given that all
witches and wizards are dressed pretty eccentrically this doesn't indicate
anything much about a sexuality.

You might argue that Dumbledore being gay isn't really relevant to the story,
or maybe you wouldn't if you listen to some of my previous episodes about the
importance of queer representation in media.

But in the _not_ saying it, my dear listeners, a lot of other assumptions come
to fill in the gaps.

JK also stated that when she was reading through the script for the sixth film,
she edited out a line about an old girlfriend of Dumbledore's, scribbling that
he was gay in the margin.

(I just realized, he's quite _literally_ a *margin*alized identity.)

And that's heteronormativity for you.

Since JK had not started to tumble to sexuality before that point, the script
writers assumed heterosexuality.

In the final book, Deathly Hallows, Harry reads Dumbledore's biography written
by Rita Skeeter. In it, Skeeter implies that Harry and Dumbledore were
unnaturally close. That their relationship was unhealthy and sinister. And that
Harry had a troubled adolescence (well, no shit).

The actual direct quote is: "I devote an entire chapter to the whole
Potter–Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister.
Again, your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there's no
question that Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from the word go.
Whether that was really in the boy's best interest, well, we'll see. But
certainly an open secret that Potter had a most troubled adolescence."

Now, readers are probably well aware that Rita Skeeter is full of shit.

Some of you may be aware of the myth linking gay men with pedophilia. It's a
pretty disgusting mess with no basis in fact. And, I wonder if Skeeter is
building on that to fuel nasty rumors about Dumbledore. Obviously she's trying
to cause some kind of aspersion here and I have a hard time reading it as
anything else. Point is. It can be read as a very vague reference to
Dumbledore's sexuality.

Even so, it is a gross and inaccurate one. Is this really the closest we get it
to Dumbledore sexuality being explicit in the text?

Well, no, thank god.

His relationship with Grindelwald is usually the clincher. It's— it's the thing
that people bring out when they want to talk about how it's obvious.

There is no explicit moment in text about their relationship, but there are a
couple of quotes that hint at it. In his letter to Grindelwald, Albus writes:
"I do not complain, for if you had not been expelled, we would never have met."

He also later explains to Harry that Gellert's ideas inflamed him, that he
pictured them both as glorious leaders of the revolution, and that he closed
his eyes to what Grindelwald truly was.

Now, me with my rainbow tinted glasses, reads that as supergay. But also, in a
heteronormative society, it could just be taken as deep platonic affection,
maybe.

Rowling has confirmed that Dumbledore loved Grindelwald in the same Carnegie
Hall speech in 2007 where she outed him.

It may be that the true nature of their relationship will be explored in
Fantastics Beasts, and we'll get in-world confirmation that Dumbledore is gay.

That would be cool but, I'm worried given how Grindelwald is a villain and
(spoilers!) his behavior towards Credence in the first Fantastic Beasts movie,
that he'll play directly into the evil gay manipulative pedophile stereotype.

Uugh.

Out of curiosity, I googled hints that Dumbledore was gay, and I got a lot of
stuff about his outfits. He wears a floral print at one point. And the fact
that his pet is literally flaming. There was also mention of his levels of
emotional sensitivity.

Obviously, nothing conclusive or direct.

My favorite clue, hands down, was that so few of us realized he was gay.

Umm, it's not obvious, no one noticed, so we should have... guessed?

Well in that case, everyone in Harry Potter is queer too. Sorry, you said it.
Not me.

We get a few indications that Dumbledore is gay, some of them incidental and
based on stereotypes, some you'd only say if you're queer and desperately
trying to relate, some you'd only notice if you were really hunting.

(Apparently an anagram of his name is "male balds rule bod." Fucking really?!)

Some of them leaned dangerously close to the queer villain territory which is a
whole nother episode on problematic representation by itself.

And... that's it, that's all we get?

No one else is gay in the entire Harry potter universe, huh?

Can't be. Or JK would have mentioned it!

That's the issue of tokenism. Once you've pointed at one dude and gone "He's
gay." It implies that no one else is. Or you would have said because you're
sooo progressive.

Dumbledore is poor representation. It's not stated directly in text. His
relationship with the men he cares about are described salaciously as "dirty
business" by a notoriously unreliable reporter. His age and position renders
him devoid of sexuality and he dies non-threateningly single. It feels like a
shoehorned-in last minute representation designed to throw you a bone.

I think his token presence makes the world seem more heteronormative by
contrast, especially when considered against the backdrop of some of the other
shit that gets assumed around Hogwards.

---------------

The girls' dormitory stairs were designed by the founders of Hogwarts to
transform into a slide when the boys try to climb them.

Hermione says it's an old fashioned rule. And that it's due to the founders
thinking girls are more trustworthy.

It's not stated if this is the same for all houses or just Gryffindor. Not
that I don't see why it wouldn't be the case.

The tone of the scene in Order of the Phoenix is humorous. It's _funny_ that
Ron can't ascend the staircase. It's _very_ heteronormative.

It ignores the existence of folks outside the gender binary, plays into myths
about how boys can't control themselves around respecting girls' privacy and
boundaries...

Which they can, by the way. Screw "boys will be boys," boys will be held
accountable for their actions and to a higher standard of self-control.

It assumes that girls aren't going to be interested in going to the boys' dorms
for makeout sessions. And that same-gender makeouts... aren't a thing.

Am I to infer from this that the queer kids and girls are considered more
sexually responsible and so don't need magical regulations?

How about you can the old fashioned rules and have some decent sex-ed where you
discuss consent and safety, huh? They're all kids and all equally capable of
being sexually irresponsible. Because they're individuals.

There's no gendered basis for being more respectful of consent, privacy, and
boundaries other than what's trained into us by heteronormative society.

The staircases do allow for some fun trans headcanon, though, where characters'
genders are affirmed by being able or unable to climb the stairs. It's kind of
a happy accident of fans trying for some queer representation though it's
definitely not intentional on JK's part.

In the films, the staircase is the same for boys and girls so we don't run into
the same thing. But this still plenty of heteronormativity in the movie world.

---------------

Harry and Hermione's relationship is an interesting one to discuss here. It's
clear that neither character is interested in the other romantically, books or
films. But a lot of in-text and outside-text assumptions are made about their
relationship.

This is possibly due to heteronormative ideas about how men and women can't be
friends, _à la_ "When Harry Met Sally".

In-text, we get all that Rita Skeeter Witch Weekly nonsense during the
Tournament where she writes about Hermione giving potions to famous boys to
make them love her because she's not conventionally attractive. It's made very
clear this is crap.

Having gossipy dating rubbish about a boy and a girl who are friends be
criticized in-text is actually a decent move. It shows this kind of
heteronormativity exists but that it's built on false assumptions. That's neat.

Similarly, Ron's insecurities about Harry and Hermione's relationship are also
debunked.

However, in the film, Dumbledore asks Harry if he and Hermione are a thing.

I get that this could be script writers, trying to be real obvious about how
platonic Harry and Hermione are, but it's weird to have Dumbledore of all
people make that comment.

Why would a gay man assume a boy and a girl who like and respect each other are
dating? Why would the man who's best buddies with a woman, Minerva McGonnagal,
assume romance?

Especially given all the other things or any present in-text that discredit a
romantic relationship between the two. Was this question even needed?

Perhaps it was required to make it abundantly clear to audiences given how
heteronormative our society is.

Lots of people viewed Hermione in Harry's film dance in the Deathly Hallows as
romantic. Personally I prefer to read it as besties trying to cheer themselves
up in a shitty time. My friend viewed it as more of a Nietzschesque fatalistic
dance on the eve of a revolution and all destroyed. But that's a Hufflepuff and
a Ravenclaw for you.

I— it's cool. Ship however you want. But there's no denying that assumptions
about Harry and Hermione being together, play into heteronormativity. So much
so that it has been debunked repeatedly in-text.

Would that have been necessary if the world wasn't so heteronormative to begin
with? Possibly not.

And then there's the obvious JK saying that Harry and Hermione would have been
better together than Ron and Hermione. And frankly. That's bizarre.

Why are Hermione's only options these two boys that are her best friends. That
doesn't make any sense that she can only choose between the two.

Personally, I do think that Ron and Hermione work well together. but it's kind
of damning that JK seems to think her best friends are her only romantic
options.

Yikes.

---------------

The Yule Ball: the heteronormative social event of the season in Goblet of
Fire.

No mention of queer couples at all. No boyfriends dancing, no affirmative
lesbians snogging in the rose garden, and no one asks out anyone of the same
gender.

This would have done loads to normalise queer relationships, but it's just not
there at all.

(Now I've been complaining a lot so I thought maybe you guys would like a
little joke just to bring things up.

- What did asexual James Potter do when Lily declined to be his date?
- Went stag.

It's very funny.

You can't tell but I did the finger guns at my brand new shiny microphone.)

So.

In the films, dancing lessons are given to the Gryffindors, and this entire
scene reinforces heteronormative gender roles. Boys on one side, girls on the
other. The boys are leaping lions, the girls are graceful swans. Ron is made
fun of by Harry and his brothers for being made to dance with his teacher.

Of the boys, only Neville shows willingness and joy in dancing and this is
played for laughs. It's also worth noting that Neville, sweet bean that he
is... his character begins as a non-conventionally masculine wimpy comic
relief, so it's kind of _safe_ for him to enjoy dancing because ha ha. It's
just another way that he's not a traditional man.

The girls are also viewed as targets for dating by the boys.

I think Harry even says at one point: "They always travel in packs. How are we
supposed to get one of them alone to ask them?"

That's a bit creepy, Harry.

The dress robes are fairly non-specific in the book aside from Ron's, but in
the film they're derived from Muggle formal attire. No one dresses outside of
gender norms and Ron's choices are discussed repeatedly regarding his robes for
being too lacy, old fashioned, and feminine.

Given wizarding dress elsewhere in the books and how gender neutral robes are
anyway, this dress code feels pretty forced to me.

The Hogwarts uniforms in films are gendered too. Pants for boys, skirts for
girls, based on British school uniforms, I imagine. But it's an odd decision
given the, again, neutrality of robes.

At the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth book we see evidence of wizards not
really _getting_ Muggle attire, and how Muggles often dress according to gender
roles.

Most witches and wizards dress eccentricly, in brightly colored robes, and
their attempted dressing-like-muggles is unusual with no real grasp of Muggle
dress code conventions.

A wizard named Archie wears his nighty, and a ministry official tries to tell
him that this is for Muggle women only.

Thankfully Archie doesn't give any fucks. He just likes wearing it.

It's weird that we have this complete lack of understanding about gendered
clothing for magical people, and they all dress unconventionally and gender
neutrally, and yet we wind up with gendered uniforms and gendered Yule Ball
clothing in the film.

-----------

It was around this point in the script writing that I realised the episode was
going to be huge, so I've divided it into two parts. This first part covers
dormitories, Dumbledore, and dancing; the second part will into witches,
werewolves, and I'll discuss some queer — potential — queer readings of some of
my favorite characters.

In the meantime, please keep the conversation going on Twitter. Act queerly
there.

Don't be afraid to drop in your queer headcanons, tell me your thoughts about
this episode, or any of the other episodes, and because this episode is
ginormous, I actually have _several_ recommendations [of] queer media you can
check out but I will do them all in the second half of the episode.

That's just for ease in my editing, there's no other real reason for that.

But, you know, as always you can check out the Twitter and some of my previous
recommendations for queer stuff.
