This is a full transcript of [Heteronormativity At Hogwarts Part I: Dumbledore, Dormitories And Dancing][hahddd], a [Queerly There][qt] podcast
special on the [Not Saf For Work][nsfw] network. You can find the podcast in its
original audio form at the link above.

The podcast was published on September 26, 2017.

This was an experiment on if pre-transcribing something mechanically could help
with manually transcribing it, or if it would be an impediment, or just
neutral. This last episode concludes this run of three transcribing
experiences: [the first][ie1] was a purely human transcription, and [the
second][ie2] compared a human transcription to a machine transcription within
the same corpus (although the post does not show overlapping parts).

The machine transcription uses [IBM's Watson][stt] speech-to-text engine.

 - 0: I'm going to be talking about hitch normativity in the why the Harry potter universe.

 - 0: But I soon hit you normativity ad hoc work because I entered the residence better.

 - 2: Obviously.

 - 0: The episode contains spoilers for the Harry potter films and books.

 - 0: Let's get some definitions out of the way first.

 - 2: Hatcher normativity.

 - 0: I Tim coined by Michael worn out in nineteen ninety one.

 - 2: Refers to earn per violent.

 - 0: And invisible norms surrounding heterosexuality.

 - 2: Basically.

 - 0: It's the assumption of monogamous straight relationships between substantive men and women are the.

 - 2: Only way to pay.

 - 2: Arm at least.

 - 0: The default setting and anything else is.

 - 0: Other.

 - 2: It ties innately web.

 - 0: Sites normativity which is the assumption that everyone has since Gina and that men and women have natural roles.

 - 0: Those that fall outside of the standard roles and relationships are not hand socially develop it.

 - 0: Harry potter is a series of books and movies that's because he's in the nineties.

 - 2: I'm.

 - 2: Because we've got a lot of stuff to get.

 - 2: Let's start.

 - 0: At the beginning.

 - 0: Dumbledore day was the day I called over generation headmaster of Hogwarts.

 - 0: You probably know where I'm going with this.

 - 2: In two thousand and seven.

 - 0: JK Rollings revealed that albus Dumbledore was getting but was criticized for not making explicit in the text.

 - 2: We get some hints that.

 - 0: You could call them that barrenness you'd notice if you weren't going through it with a fine tooth comb like yours truly.

 - 0: Envelopes was done in the very first description of Dumbledore says that he's wearing high heeled buckle boots and a purple cloak.

 - 2: Well.

 - 0: Undeniably fabulous.

 - 2: Obviously.

 - 0: Wearing purple and heels doesn't make you get a.

 - 2: His outfit does fall outside the Muggle gender norms but given that all witches and wizards.

 - 0: Are addressed pretty eccentrically this doesn't indicate anything much about six.

 - 2: You might.

 - 0: Argue.

 - 0: That dumb little being gay isn't really relevant to the story.

 - 2: Or.

 - 0: Maybe you wouldn't if you listen to some of my previous episodes about the importance of quick rips the taste and media.

 - 2: But in the what.

 - 0: Saying it my dear listeners.

 - 2: A lot of.

 - 0: Other assumptions.

 - 0: Come to fill in the gaps.

 - 2: JK also stated.

 - 0: That when she was reading through the script for the sex phone.

 - 2: She isn't out.

 - 0: A line about an old girlfriend of dumbells.

 - 0: Scribbling that he was gay in the margin.

 - 2: I just realize.

 - 0: Quite literally a marginalized identity.

 - 2: And that's Hitra normativity for you.

 - 0: Since JK had not started to tumble to sexuality before that point the script writers assumed heterosexual.

 - 0: And the final book deathly Hallows.

 - 0: Harry Reid stumbles biography written by Rita Skeeter anise skater implies the Harry and Dumbledore were unnaturally close.

 - 2: That their relationship was unhealthy and sinister.

 - 0: And that Harry had a troubled little isms well no shit.

 - 2: The.

 - 0: Actual direct quote is.

 - 0: I devoted an entire chapter to the whole pothole Dumbledore relationship.

 - 0: It's been cold unhealthy even sinister.

 - 2: Again.

 - 0: Your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there's no question that double took an unnatural interest impala from the word go are.

 - 2: Whether that was really in the boy's best interest.

 - 0: Well we'll see.

 - 2: But certainly a.

 - 0: Open secret the pot had a most trouble and listens.

 - 2: Now.

 - 0: Rate is the probably well aware that Rita Skeeter is full of shit.

 - 2: Some of you.

 - 0: May be aware of the math linking gay men with pedophilia.

 - 2: It's.

 - 0: A pretty disgusting mess with no basis in fact.

 - 2: And.

 - 2: I want.

 - 0: To Skeeter is building on that to fuel nasty rumors about Dumbledore.

 - 2: Obviously she's trying to cause some kind of a spirit in here and.

 - 0: I have a hard time reading it as anything else.

 - 2: Point is.

 - 0: It can be read as a very vague reference to double sexuality.

 - 0: I saw her it is a gross an inaccurate one.

 - 2: Is this.

 - 0: Really the closest we get it turn Dumbledore sexuality being explicit in the text.

 - 2: Well.

 - 0: Not thank god.

 - 0: His relationship with print award in the years away the clinch I it's it's nothing the people bring out when they want to talk about how it's OPS.

 - 2: There is no.

 - 2: In his letter to Grindelwald.

 - 0: Albus rights.

 - 0: I do not complain for if you had not been expelled we would never have made.

 - 0: He also later explains to Harry that Gil its ideas inflamed him that he pictured them both as glorious leaders of the revolution and that he closed his eyes to what Greta will truly laws.

 - 2: Now.

 - 0: Me with my rainbow tinted glasses.

 - 2: Reads that as.

 - 0: Two per day.

 - 2: But alas.

 - 0: No hitter number of society it could just be taken as deep platonic depiction.

 - 0: Maybe.

 - 0: Rolling has confirmed that dumb little love going to walled in the same county and hold speech in two thousand and seven wishy out of him.

 - 2: It.

 - 0: May be that the true nature of their relationship will be explored in fantastic bass.

 - 0: And we'll get them world confirmation the tumblers gay.

 - 2: That would be cool but.

 - 0: I'm worried given how Grenoble is a villain and.

 - 2: Spoilers.

 - 0: His behavior towards credence.

 - 0: In the first fantastic bass moving.

 - 2: The.

 - 0: Whole play directly into the evil gay manipulative pitfall stereotype needs.

 - 0: Out of curiosity.

 - 2: I googled.

 - 0: Hints that Dumbledore was day I got a lot of stuff about it outfits.

 - 0: A few indications that Dumbledore is gay so them incidental and based on stereotypes some you'd only say if you a queer and desperately trying to relate some you only notice if you really hunting.

 - 0: Apparently an anagram of his name is male balds rule bod really.

 - 0: Some of them leaned dangerously close to the queer villain territory which is a whole nother if Saddam problematic representation by itself.

 - 2: And.

 - 2: That's it that's.

 - 0: All we get.

 - 0: No one else is gay Indians higher Harry potter universe how.

 - 0: How they.

 - 2: Were taking.

 - 0: Would have mentioned it.

 - 0: That's the issue of tokenism.

 - 2: Once you've pointed at one third and gone.

 - 2: It implies that no one else's.

 - 0: Who you would have seen it because.

 - 0: Progress the.

 - 0: By editorials Lee underlie were reported.

 - 0: His aides imposition arenas him devoid of sexuality and he dies non threatening Lee single.

 - 0: It feels like he sure horn N. last minute representation designed to throw you a barn.

 - 2: I think his token prisons.

 - 0: Makes the world seem more heteronormative by contrast especially when considered against the backdrop of the.

 - 0: All the shit they get this year around hope what.

 - 0: It goes Dimitry stands we designed by the founders of Hogwarts to transform into a slide when the boys try to climb.

 - 0: Hermione says it's an old fashioned rule.

 - 2: And that same gender make outs.

 - 0: On the thing.

 - 0: And my Thun flow from this the queer kids and girls are considered more sexually responsible answer don't need medical regulations.

 - 0: How about you can the old fashioned rules and have some decent sakes aid we discuss consent insight to how.

 - 2: There's no arm.

 - 0: Gene did basis for being more respectful of consent privacy boundaries other than what's trained into us by heteronormative society.

 - 0: The state cases do allow for some bomb trans him Canonsburg where characters dean is our family by being able or unable to climb the stairs.

 - 0: It's kind of a happy accident of bands trying for some queer presentation though it's definitely not intentional on JK's pop.

 - 0: And the film is this a case is the same for boys and girls so we don't run into the same thing.

 - 0: And the film Dumbledore asks Harry if Harry and Hermione are thing.

 - 2: I get is.
