  <p>We are walking on the road to hell<br />
we are walking on the road to hell.</p>
<p>We come from the worlds behind us,<br />
we come from the worlds of people,<br />
we come from a thousand paradises.</p>
<p>We are walking on the road to hell<br />
fleeing from your tyranny, your hate,<br />
your words, your guns, your utopia.</p>
<p>We are fleeing proudly, finally tired<br />
of living with you, near you, for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy your paradise, for we will not<br />
be coming back, not return, not ever.</p>
<p>We were your dark suns, your bright suns,<br />
your voices of happiness, your shining<br />
lights dancing to the sound of a hundred<br />
drums, your castles in your minds, your<br />
every thought and dream, your precious<br />
precious colour in your black and white<br />
world.</p>
<p>We were the black and the white and the<br />
everything in between, and the every tint.</p>
<p>You built your worlds for us, for you,<br />
bastions of freedom, fortresses of beauty.</p>
<p>You closed the roads, collapsed the gates,<br />
showed us the door yet kept us behind bars.</p>
<p>You said you loved us while beating on our<br />
homes with your rams of steel, you said you<br />
would help us while screaming you abhored us.</p>
<p>You built palaces of fear, you built theme<br />
parks dedicated to making you feel justfied.</p>
<p>We were like the wind, breathing life through<br />
windmills, and you were a giant Don Quixote,<br />
raving madly about the threat we posed you.</p>
<p>We are walking on the road to hell<br />
You can stop us no longer<br />
We are walking away<br />
Away from you<br />
Away forever<br />
Away.</p>
