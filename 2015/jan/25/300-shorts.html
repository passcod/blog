  <p>I aim to write 300 shorts.</p>
<p>I am not setting myself a timeline nor a deadline. It could take years, and
most probably will take more than one. I simply wish to write 300 shorts, not
to write 300 shorts in a set time.</p>
<p>The definition of a short for this excercise is pretty loose. I’ll include
poems, prose, fiction, non-fiction. No multi-part pieces, although breaks
between sections are allowed. I’m going to set a soft upper limit at 2500
words, although I’m pretty sure I’ll never actually reach that high in this
collection.</p>
<p>Each short will be set with this preface as a ‘parent post’, so you should find
a list in the footer, down below, just after the line asking for “Praise,
thoughts, criticism?”.</p>
<p>Wish me luck~</p>
