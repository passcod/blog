## Fanfiction

All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I explored the Harry Potter fanficdom, all nearly exclusively rated M.
Contains lemons.

- {HP/SW Legends} [The Katarn Side](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side).

  A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
  material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
  Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me _not_ to write a Star Wars
  × Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
  Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
  interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
  remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
  potential the crossover's universe has… many stories could have been written
  within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers'
  imagination. Rated T. {135k words}

Also enjoyed, but no lengthy comment:

I've been reading a lot of [Bobmin]'s stories, to honour his rich contribution
to the fandoms. These are all excellent.
