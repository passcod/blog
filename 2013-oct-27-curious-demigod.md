what if you could ask for one thing and have it either made reality or see it forbidden to you forever, at the whim of the demigod who likes to play with people by asking them this?

Regarding the prisoner dilemma problem we found in Yao's protocol, well, I think it could be 'resolved' in the socialist variant by simulating a kind of reverse binary search. A provides value X, which is constant, but B provides value Yn ∈ {0, ∞, M1, M2, M3, ..., Yreal, Mn, Mn+1, Mn+2, ...} where there are a random number of M values before and after Yreal, and each M is a random number. Then the last packet B sends is N, the position at which Yreal was really compared. Thus, by doing the double instance and synchronisation through C, the only way [here is where I realised I was wrong]

This game is open to all who wish. It usually runs for a week. If, after one week, the game has not been decided, play might continue, but players might lose interest and/or concede defeat to go and play another game. Thus you are advised to distribute Renown Points around the sixth or seventh day.
