  <blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>A project lead wanted to know who amongst her designers was the best. She set up a computer and invited them all to come up and show talent.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523818934030458882%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>Soon enough, the competition was raging fiercely. Designers from other teams and departments joined in, and they produced incredible scenes.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523819202054864897%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>The project lead wondered and marvelled at the beauty displayed, but she could not judge one designer better than another.

<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>At some point, nobody could quite remember when, a hush came upon the assembly. A developer had stepped in, and claimed something ridiculous</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523820604940488704%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>The developer had claimed he could prove he was the best, and wanted access to the computer to have his chance. There was much talk at that.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523821075340075008%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>The developer was about to get thrown out by laughing designers when the project lead intervened. &quot;Show me what you can do&quot; she challenged.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523821371281780736%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>The developer stepped to the computer. He closed all the windows. Photoshop, Illustrator, the best programs for the job. He opened MS Paint.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523821754683109376%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>He grabbed the mouse lightly, positioned it carefully, and in one fluid movement, drew a circle on the screen.

<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>A baffled designer asked: &quot;How can that possibly show you as the best?&quot; The other designers soon rallied to this. The proj. lead was silent.</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523823015407013888%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
<blockquote class=“twitter-tweet” data-partner=“tweetdeck”><p>The developer said, calmly: &quot;This is a perfect circle, drawn with a mouse, on MS Paint, with the brush tool. Are you capable of this feat?&quot;</p>&mdash; Félix Saparelli (@passcod) <a href=%e2%80%9chttps_/twitter.com/passcod/status/523823504064397312%e2%80%9d.html>October 19, 2014</a></blockquote>
