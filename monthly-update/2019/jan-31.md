## Monthly updates are now actually monthly

The 10th-day thing got old. It was an artifact of when I actually started this
monthly thing, but the confusion of writing about half of the past month and
half of the current was really odd.

So now updates are published on the last day of the month, at 20 oâ€™clock local.

## Monthly updates may not actually be monthly anymore

Two years ago when I did those every month, I did make an effort to get
something done every month. Last year it was a bit lackluster. This year, I'm
basically throwing in the towel. Updates will happen, but they might not happen
every month. Or maybe they will. Habits are hard to break, and I'm not trying to
break this one, so we'll see how it goes.
