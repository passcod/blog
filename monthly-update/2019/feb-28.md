## Fanfiction

So what I did this month is finish all my fics in instance, and then I went
through an entire collection and opened all fics that interested me in tabs, and
then spent the rest of the month working my way into “making my browser usable
again” which was kinda completely unnecessary but also I read some good fics!

 - {Naruto} **[Yeah, Kunai are cool but have you had dessert?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13704930)**. {260k words atow}
 - {Naruto} [What Once Was Will Never Be](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11668914). {92k words atow}
 - {007} **[Ordinary Numbers](https://archiveofourown.org/works/705037)**. {44k words}
 - {Naruto} [Face Like Thunder](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10458159). {133k words atow}
 - {The Flash} [Tempus Fugit](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6262273). {71k words}
 - {Marvel} [‘Iron Spark’ series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/892473). {58k words atow}
 - {Naruto} [‘Familial Bonds’ series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/555448). {183k words atow}
 - {Naruto} **[As Is the Sea Marvelous](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5256338)**. {59k words}
   I kept thinking that the characters from this fic should meet the characters
   from Flamethrower's Harry Potter saga, because they have that same way of
   expressing themselves through scathe and scoff. They'd hit it off, I'm sure,
   after Nizar scolds them for being psychotic idiots.
 - {Naruto} [Family's Just Another Word For Something Left To Lose](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6649681). {62k words}
