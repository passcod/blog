## Fiction

Also see [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/passcod/status/1153619777119649792)
where I essentially live-tweet the fic browsing process. If I have fun doing it,
I might keep at it and re-link the month’s first in each update.

I’ve also been reading and voting on this year’s Hugo Awards slate. I haven’t
read _everything_, unfortunately, but I had a lot of fun and tears with the
shorter works. They were hard to rank!
