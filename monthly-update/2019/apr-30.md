## What

**[What]** is a new little tool I made this month, that tracks what I’m working
on at the moment. These monthly updates often have summaries of things I’ve
started or finished or want to talk about, but they don’t have everything and
they don't really do any good job at showing continuity or breaks or anything.

[What] is not limited to fiction or software work, and has a space within each
entry for “media” links, i.e. Twitter threads about the activity. That also acts
as a kind of archive and historical reference.

So here you go! Watch me work away: [what.passcod.name][What].

## Pinn

I’ve started work on a browser extension to make reading, stats-ing, and
managing fanfics easier! I hope to be done sometime next month, and am working
on it in between working on...

## Notify 5.0

Not **the** Notify 5.0 vaporware release I’ve been talking for the past two
years, but an actual, made of real code, Notify release! It's a big refactoring
that will fix a bunch of issues and open some cool possibilities...

but honestly? At the core it’s not even about that. This work and this release
is about me getting re-acquainted with the codebase as it stands today, and
bringing it forward to the standard I want it to be at now. I _didn’t know how
most of the library worked_ until a few weeks ago. Obviously that made
supporting and maintaining it hard. So now I’ve got a much more solid knowledge
and I’m improving that every day.

This is both hard to admit, to myself too, and it’s not something I feel
comfortable sharing on or near the project itself (not very inspiring!), but I
feel okay sharing it here, and maybe I’ll work up to putting it out to a wider
audience over time, too.
