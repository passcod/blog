## Abandoning Notify

I made the decision to abandon Notify. I wrote lots about it, both [on Github]
and [on Twitter], but the shortest justification is this:

> \[Notify\] sparks *negative joy*, so I’m Marie-Kondo-ing it out.

Turns out however that abandoning such a large piece of software and my life
isn’t simple. I’m not taking it back, ever at all if I can manage it, but
getting to the point of it being off my hands completely is not all
straightforward. I do hope it gets there soonish, though, because otherwise
quite a few crates and part of the ecosystem will start not working anymore.

I also hope I’m making this transition less painful than other abandonments I’ve
seen in the OSS space before, though. My goal is to reclaim my own time and joy,
not to say fuck you to any part of Rust or cause misery to anyone.
