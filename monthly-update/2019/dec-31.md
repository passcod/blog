## Donations

This year I decided to forgo donating to organisations. This had many reasons,
most of which boiled down to most organisations sending me about a ream of paper
each in "pwease donate" advertising throughout this year, which I gather doesn't
come cheap, so at my support level I estimate they spent at least half of my
dollars on asking me more dollars, which is ridiculous. I'm sure they also do
good work, I'm not sure they particularly need _my_ cash to do that.

One organisation that is the exception, and the sole organisation in my donation
list this year is [PAPA], and I gave them $300 sometime back in May.

[PAPA]: https://papa.org.nz

So here I was wondering what I should do. One thing I've always wanted to do
since I started doing this regularly but was never really sure how to is direct
donation, i.e. "just giving people money." So this year, starting in November, I
went and actually tried that. I figured out the parameters and made [a tweet]:

I didn't really get many returns but then I trawled givealittle for matching
people and donated there too. By December 3rd I had spent about ⅔ the budget and
exhausted my search to this point, so I resolved to take two weeks before trying
again.

On December 20th, JK Rowling made an extremely TERFy tweet and I was kinda mad.
I was seeing a lot of condemnation from allies but not a lot of action. It's
kinda hard to do anything to Rowling, though. Instead, I had [this idea]:

[RY]: https://www.ry.org.nz

There were a lot more people answering, and I was able to help all of them. So
that was a huge success. In total, I distributed more than $1500 to more than
twenty people, many of them trans, many of them in Aotearoa.

Perhaps in an economic, macro-level kinda thing, donating all $1500 to [RY]
would have helped more people, but it's harder to see. And of course, none of
the people I gave money to are registered charities, so I won't get any tax
rebate for the 2019 tax year. That's alright. I mostly want to help people, and
this year I did that by distributing what is to me a little bit of cash to
people for whom it is a lot.

We'll see what next year brings.
