## Fanfiction

I think I've finally closed off the fanfic-devouring void in my heart. Now it's
more like a trickle. I'm slowly finishing off a list of good fics I'd saved up
"for later" and I'm not adding any, so eventually I'll get to Fanfic Zero.

Of course, I'm still reading the updates as they come through. Through random
sampling, I've estimated I read about 120k words of fanfic updates per week.

 - {HP} [‘MWPP’ series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/501220). {184k words atow}
 - {Naruto} **[‘The Life and Times of a Shinobi Den Mother’ series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/70083)**. {51k words atow}
 - {SW} **[‘Sith Apprentice: Darth Venge’ series](https://archiveofourown.org/series/400588)**. {222k words atow}
