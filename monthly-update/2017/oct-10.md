## Writing

### This blog

After doing some quick calculations, I found out that if I write about three
thousand more words in this blog before the end of the year, I'll have written
more in this blog this year than _all prior years combined_! Now that's a pretty
fun goal.

### Naema

Writing has been slower than usual, which is perhaps pushing back the end date.

I have been having difficulties reconciling Leia's character with how I portray
her in the one interaction that's really important in this fic, my plans for the
story warring with who she is verily. I think I've got it now, but Leia is
definitely the hardest character I've had to write about.

I've been writing and thinking a lot more about Thabeskan culture and history,
as that is an important part of the interactions between my two protagonists.
That may have caused a slight change of structure and that in turn may push back
completion, but oh well. So long as it improves the story…
