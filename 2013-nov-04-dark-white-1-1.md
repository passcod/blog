My mom's new boyfriend is kinda weird. For one thing, they never kiss or do anything in front of me, which is cool because that's kinda gross but also makes me wonder if he's really a boyfriend. Mom has had a few boyfriends. None have lasted very long, no more than a couple of months, and then she swears never to trust the essobees again, whatever that means, and spends more time with me for half a year before getting a new one. Some boyfriends were just-out-and-about-boyfriends, mom went out with them and they never came to stay; some were all-into-your-business-boyfriends, trying to help me with school and cooking dinners; some were eww-boyfriends, kissing and cuddling without caring who was watching.

This boyfriend doesn't do anything with mom that I can see, and he lives with us, and he cooks sometimes and helps mom with the laundry and takes care of me when she goes out shopping. He's like some husbands and dads in books I read and friends' families. Come to think of it, I've never heard him nor mom say anything about love or whatever and they call each other by name and not those stupid Honey or Dear or Sweety or Angel or Babe or the roll-my-eyes-moronic Hon, Bunny, and Kitten. No, with these two it's always Caroline and Terri and Cindi (that's me!).

But enough about mom's maybe-boyfriend this book is about me! Hello!

My name's Cindi and I am writing this book to tell you about myself because I have a ~~bloody~~ wonderful homework assignment where you either have to write a diary for the future or make up a story using pictures of miniature people dolls and dolls are really dull so I have to write a diary even though I don't really want to. Sorry teach! Oh and it's 'for the future', which means I have to write it as if people reading it weren't from here and now. Weeeeeiiiiirrd.

I've noticed the magic smell around my house is stronger than usual. Maybe it's the winter arriving early. I've heard that out-of-whack season changes can affect the atmospheric magic, and this isn't strong enough to really be a magician, unless she's a real pro and can mask her magic or some other crazy thing. Or anyway that's how it'd be in novels. But this is real life and in real life you don't have weird creepy strong magicians running around the hills and breaking into uninteresting houses just to do some super-quiet no-effect magic and leave and not do anything else. So I say it's the seasons because that makes so much more sense.

Anyway I'm going out now. My friends are going to the mall to hang out and they've made me promise to come along this time, not "stay holed up here" as they say. I don't know. I like being here, it's so much greener and fresher and more vivid and prettier than in the city, but the city has friends and people and shops and street performers and public teleporters and fancy new carpets to look at and drool over. What? You think carpet-gazing is something *boys* do? Naaaah! They're totally awesome and everything. Why should I not?

To be clear, I'm not overly fond of tweaking the internals and admiring the engineering: it's nice to know, it can be fun, but what I'm really into is the stuff that you don't see everyday. There's your casual carpet and your racing carpet and your long-distance carpet and these are the ones most people know about. But there's really obscure ones, these are the interesting ones. There's great big, really big, even massive ones; the biggest I've seen had a house on it, the biggest that's been photographied in books is the Alm'aja'd, a small town of travelers that built itself with many different people roping their rags together and knotting the magic until the thing spanned hundreds of metres in all directions. It's said it never touches the ground anymore, and when it comes to a city for trading it moves around during the day to avoid shading the same houses for too long at a time.

However, there's rumours and stories of even larger carpets. There's tales of a castle floating in the air by itself, no weaving involved, using some mysterious artifacts. I think that's ~~bull~~ a myth. There's other stories, written accounts even, of the Cloth City, built entirely of fibres woven together. The spell binding it and flying it made as a unique entity, built by a single magician, who created it for an ancient kingdom a loooong time ago and then vanished, leaving his creation behind, with no instructions on how to operate it. It is said to have been dragged by sails for a few years before getting caught in a hurricane; the Cloth City supposedly survived, but its inhabitants and dumbfounded owners left it over the sea and departed in search of a magician who could control it. When they came back *years* later it was long gone, either pushed by the winds or taken by a passing wizard.

And that's just one story! But now I really have to go. I'm going to take the diary with me, though, writing what I know could be a good idea after all… Oh! I forgot to explain what carpets are! This 'future' thing is not obvious at all. I'll do the explainy bit later. City time!

I HAVE A CARPET OF MY OWN! It's an old one and it was cheap but I missed just a little to buy it so Ron lent me a little so NOW I HAVE A CARPET this is so exciting. The seller told me it wasn't in great shape and couldn't fly very well but it looks ancient and I LOVE IT.

Oh yeah I did have to explain what carpets are to the future-person-who-doesn't-know-what-I'm-blabbing-about. Well then. So, a carpet is essentially a piece of cloth that has magic woven into it. Almost all carpets are used to fly around or otherwise transport stuff, although I have heard about carpets being used to trade spells in the old days so that's something too. Weaving magic into cloth is actually easier if the cloth is itself woven and the weave is visible so you can the magician can more easily visualise the pattern.

Carpets can be used by everyone, not only magicians, which is what makes them useful and so common. It's also what makes the magic so difficult to perform. Nowadays there's three competing spells that are premade by very skilled magicians, replicated, and applied to the cloth by less skilled magicians. But you still have to involve manual magic work at every stage of the process save the making of the cloth, so fast production isn't possible. There are only very few carpets out there that were spelled uniquely, they're quite rare in fact. The last time I saw one was at an auction and it fetched more money than I had ever thought could.

So, onto my carpet: I haven't really looked at it yet, I just ensured it could float me up in the shop and then I rolled it underarm — it was a bit awkward to walk around with it, I'll have to find a better way to carry it — but I want to find out what its make is and if it has any special abilities and why the seller told me it "doesn't fly great". Also I should really clean it, that will take a while though, it doesn't look machine-washable. Too bad I don't have a magician handy.
