## Fanfiction

All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I finished (for the moment!) my exploration of the Harry Potter
fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.

- {HP} [The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/78/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House), followed by [The Hogwarts Six and the Darkest Wizard](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard).

  Has complex plots with being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
  foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they're used,
  without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
  time travel mechanisms I have ever read since HPMoR, and it probably
  surpasses that, even: used hundreds of times, over a year thrice folded on
  itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
  plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in HPMoR where we are
  told Dumbledore+Snape+Potter-Evans-Verres make plans and schemas and diagrams
  but there's only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and
  explained. And even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn't
  depend entirely on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance
  planning, munchkinning, and other techniques all combine together in an
  explosive mix, with no less than three different plots going on at the same
  time… at any given time. And that's just the first book! The second book is
  ongoing, and I am loving it. {273k + 131k words atow}
