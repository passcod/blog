As I'm participating in two tournaments at this moment, I have various
tidbits going through my head.

***

> I have decided to play three different styles:
  - In Wallyjack's games, I will play my usual style
  - In 27th games, playing as black, I will play fast
  - In 27th games, playing as white, I will play slow

***

> There seems to be a tendency for players to attack the king's weak side
> as an early game technique. It's frustrating (as it's painfully obvious),
> but it should be defended against nonetheless.

***

> Ooo, this one's a strange one: all our pawns intact, rooks and kings mirrored, and nothing else on the board. Play becomes tricky.
