  <p>Are you, are you<br />
Coming up with me<br />
They say they will be<br />
They say up, will we be<br />
Brave enough, brave to follow<br />
To leave, to flee, to go<br />
If we split, to leave me<br />
To mine and only<br />
Fate.</p>
<hr />
<p>When the proponents of tyranny<br />
come to us and ask forgiveness:<br />
“I’m sorry.”<br />
“I didn’t know it would get so bad.”<br />
We will tell them: “Too late.<br />
Too little. The toll has already rung.”</p>
<p>We will not forgive.<br />
We will not forget.<br />
We will weep for the fallen.<br />
We will endure.</p>
<hr />
<p>What am I supposed to say<br />
to young people coming to me<br />
wanting to leave this sad world<br />
because at least now<br />
it would be on their terms?</p>
<hr />
<p>They are at our doors.<br />
They are our neighbours.<br />
They are our family.<br />
They are taking us.<br />
They are not returning us.<br />
They are denying us.<br />
They are ignoring us.</p>
<p>I don’t know which hurts more:<br />
their blows, their betrayal,<br />
their torture, their murder,</p>
<p>or their indifference.</p>
<hr />
<p>Are we out of sight?<br />
Are we out of night?</p>
<p>Our world has already tumbled<br />
Our life, for years now, has bled</p>
<p>Burn our secrets<br />
Burn our hearts<br />
Burn our love</p>
<hr />
<p>Seal your lips forever, little one<br />
Or forget you ever were different.<br />
Rejoin your friends, embrace their joy,<br />
bury your truth deep inside yourself.<br />
Learn to smile again,<br />
learn to smile the scars away,<br />
forget yourself little one,<br />
at least you’ll live another day.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s the end of the line<br />
It’s the end of our time<br />
It’s the very last step.</p>
<p>Too tired, too broken<br />
we have stopped running.</p>
<p>Our final wish:<br />
to go soaring into the skies<br />
to fade away into the night</p>
<p>Our blood running free<br />
A red sunset<br />
A tide coming out<br />
My soul drying out.</p>
<hr />
<p>(…)</p>
<hr />
<p>You told us to run<br />
You told us to be free<br />
You kept our secrets<br />
You were broken for us<br />
Still you did not speak</p>
<p>We thank you<br />
We thank you<br />
We thank you all</p>
<p>We will remember you<br />
We’ve built monuments<br />
We’re telling stories</p>
<p>At long last, with tyranny defeated<br />
We stand here honouring you<br />
Who made it all possible<br />
But didn’t get to see the end</p>
<p>We weep for the fallen<br />
We run into the sky<br />
We smile true to our soul<br />
We remember who we are<br />
We restore our hearts<br />
We return to ourselves<br />
We heal the scars<br />
We dream at night<br />
We weep for the fallen</p>
<p>The toll has rung one final time.</p>
