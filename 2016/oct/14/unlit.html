  <p>“You shouldn’t be driving.”<br />
“I haven’t had a drink.”<br />
“You know what I mean.”<br />
“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I drove on, Sani besides me.<br />
Stopped at the lights, fumbled with my phone, trying to put music on.<br />
Light turns green.<br />
Grip the wheel with one hand, shut the phone with the other, make an awkward run into the avenue.<br />
No cars around still, but more homes and driveways.</p>
<p>I turn into my lane, streetlight shining down</p>
<p>on me<br />
and the empty<br />
passenger seat.</p>
