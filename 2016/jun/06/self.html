  <p>Selflove, selfhate, selfwhatever<br />
I am a professional selfhater<br />
I do, every day, my regulation 24 hours<br />
And some more, for my own pleasures<br />
Every day, a little more, without fail.</p>
<p>Selflove, selfhate, what does it fucking matter<br />
I am a professional selfhater<br />
Every morning, every evening<br />
Every afternoon, and from nine to noon<br />
It’s my life, my death perhaps, it’s my very own tale.</p>
<p>In the association of professional selfhaters<br />
Selflove, selfhate, all together, all betters<br />
All infinite shades of black and white<br />
Shining down; a rainbow of moonlight<br />
Every day, every night, every one, every all.</p>
<p>Until one day perhaps — it’s the dream — none at all.</p>
