  <h2>Sassbot</h2>
<p>Not doing NaNoWriMo this year, but I’m still maintaining <a href="https://github.com/storily/rogare">the bot</a>!</p>
<p>(And what a wonderful thing to be coding in Ruby again!)</p>
<p>This year it got some sweet upgrades, including a new database backend (to store
richer information and perform more powerful queries), a bunch more sources for
its <code>!name</code> command, and an adaptation to Discord because the channel moved.</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>I’ve started on a cool art project mapping all earthquakes around New Zealand
from 1900 til now (early data is a bit imprecise, but it works out) using some
interesting techniques for the rendering. I hope to be done during the month.</p>
<p>Specifically, after doing the data crunching, I transposed the key positions
onto an A2 piece of white solid cardboard / foamboardish material. Then I
painted each dot (hundreds of dots so far, at about ⅓ done) to approximate size
in clear nail polish resin. The idea is then to splash ink onto the sheet, and
the ink should slide off the resin while adhering to the cardboard.</p>
<p>In the end, I hope to have an earthquake map in a form reminiscent to a night
sky star map, with some interesting random flow effects from the ink, and a
tactile/glossy feel to its surface.</p>
<p>We’ll see how it goes.</p>
<h2>Laser</h2>
<p>I’ve acquired a small 80x80mm 2W laser engraver. It should arrive closer to the
end of the month, and I’m excited to try new projects and experiments with it!</p>
<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>I’ve done some preparatory experiments for clear resin casting using cork molds
for fast prototyping. I’ve also got glow-in-the-dark powder, graphite, stone
powder, metal powder… all possibility for engineered materials of various
capabilities and styles.</p>
<p>Not quite sure where I’m going with this, but it could be interesting.</p>
<h2>End-of-year sec cons</h2>
<p>I’m going to both purplecon and kiwicon! Actually I’m more excited about
purplecon, but I have a kiwicon ticket so why not. Hopefully I’ll be seeing
friends there too!</p>
<h2>Fanfiction</h2>
<p>I think I’ve finally closed off the fanfic-devouring void in my heart. Now it’s
more like a trickle. I’m slowly finishing off a list of good fics I’d saved up
“for later” and I’m not adding any, so eventually I’ll get to Fanfic Zero.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m still reading the updates as they come through. Through random
sampling, I’ve estimated I read about 120k words of fanfic updates per week.</p>
