①  
heat on my skin  
a flowery perfume  
just a hint  
not too strong  
carol is here  

②  
"hey sis"  
"hey ben"  
no more words  
i feel at home  
fading back to sleep  

③  
a doctor is here  
or three  
mom and dad too  
perfume gone, sis gone?  

④  
i am blind  
"i can see that"  
joke falls flat  
did i hear a sob?  

⑤  
my legs can move  
painful, burns  
but they can move  
also my arms my head  

⑥  
i have burns  
all over  
but these heal  

⑦  
my sight  
won't
