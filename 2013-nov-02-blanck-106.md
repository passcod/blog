*It happened during the night but we didn't think anything of it.*

As I get on the bus to go to school people look a bit weirded out, but I miss it and wonder what's wrong with me. As we approach the school district though I notice something's off: there's much less students on the streets than usual. There's a few, and not just my kind, so it's not that the school is closed and *they* made sure we didn't know. Maybe I'm late? Nope, the bus's clock is showing me I have an ample twenty minutes left.

I don't even think of checking my phone. I have a pretty basic cellphone, not a smart phone or what have you, and no watch either â€” equal part lack of money and cautiousness: can't smash or lose what you don't have. Or, more likely, get it smashed or stolen or destroyed in some other inventive way. At least Nokia bricks are so notoriously indestructible they've stopped trying.

My bus drops me off half a block before the school gates, the walk uneventful, I'm so used to try to be alone that I do notice there are less people walking about, but not so much that it registers as being weird or anything. Maybe there's a road accident on a main artery and people aren't getting here? I don't really care.

It's when I pass the threshold that I notice something is really really off. There's no hubbub, the usual shouts and cries and laughs and general kid noise replaced by silence and a whispering. Why are people whispering outdoors?
