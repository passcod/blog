I just don't get people who say school is boring.

Annoying? Yes. Lonely? Can be. Time-consuming? Only if you've got something better to do. I guess most boys would rather be at home playing with video games. Or girls, for that matter. Girls playing video games, not boys playing with girls, although that certainly happens too. I don't play video games. I might if I could, but the lack of spare change means a lack in fancy electronics, and mom only has a computer from work. I never touch it. I don't play with boys either. Once upon a time, I cared about such things, but I was never pretty, popular, forth-coming enough to get there.

I've ceased to care quite a while ago. I find it easier to let go of the social aspects of school and just focus on the work, and on reading as much of the books in the small highschool library we've got. I go to the town's library once a week, bring home a pile of books, novels of all genres, and when in school I go to its library morning and afternoon, checking books in and out, never taking any back home.

I spend class reading. I spend lunch reading. I spend morning break reading. I spend bus rides reading. I tried to read in between classes, in the few minutes it takes to walk outside and wait for everyone to get settled in again, but neither teachers nor bullies like it. So I wait to be invisible in class again, and I read.

I read science fiction behind my textbook in history, because I rarely get called on and often get it right; I have read that history textbook cover to cover several times over already. I read fantasy in biology, openly, because the teacher gave up long ago, and not because of me; I still get good marks on tests, as will every subject. I read romance in maths, I read horror in chemistry, I read thrillers in physics, I read manga in arts supposedly as part of a research project, and I read erotica in english while we study Shakespeare, and Shakespeare while we study anything else.

Erotica being the only books I bring in from the outside. They don't have it at the school library! I'm not supposed to read erotica, mind you, I'm not eighteen yet, and I know that saying "all the other girls are *getting laid*" isn't a proper defense, but nobody will ever ask anyway. After all, I am invisible.
