**Small Grants** is an unincorporated non-profit organisation that offers small
grants to individuals and organisations in New Zealand for public-interest and
social-good projects.

Small Grants allocates funds between $200 and $2000 per project.

Projects need to:

 - be and happen _in New Zealand_, either entirely or for the majority,
   and

 - respect minorities and marginalised peoples and communities,
   and

 - benefit the public interest and/or the social good,
   and

 - have a clear defined objective,
   and

 - have a plan for what the money will be used for, within one year.

Projects need _not_ be non-profit or non-commercial themselves.

Funds will be provided as a lump sum through direct banking on the agreed date.

Projects agree to:

 - use the grant monies for the project's purposes (i.e. they’re not income),
   and

 - provide a receipt within three working days of the money being received,
   and

 - return any unused monies from the grant after one year, or at project end,
   and

 - provide **three** reports as such:
   + a mid-way progress report after six months, or at some point around the
     middle of the project for shorter agreed times,
   + a completion report after one year, or at project end,
   + a retrospective report no sooner than one month and no later than six
     months after project end.

Reports are free-form, but must include:

 - an accounting of what the grant monies were used for so far,
   and

 - a summary of where the project is at.

No admission criteria is made public, and neither replies nor acceptance are
guaranteed. (**Small Grants** reserves the right to delete and disregard your
correspondence for any or no reason prior to acceptance, after which records
will be kept for up to seven years or as per legal obligations. You have the
right to request access and correction of your details as per the Privacy Act,
and may request your personal information be destroyed after your grant.)

To apply, send an email to **small-grants@passcod.name**, with:

 - your name and your organisation’s name, if applying on behalf of one,
   and

 - a description of your project, including how it will benefit the public
   interest and/or the social good,
   and

 - a summary of what you plan to achieve with funding,
   and

 - a statement and/or evidence to support your and your project’s respect of
   minorities and marginalised peoples and communities, if the project is not
   itself directly benefiting such groups,
   and

 - a plan or outline of how the grant will be used within one year, or within
   a shorter timeframe, and what that timeframe is,
   and

 - a range of how much funding you are applying for.

Further discussion and details may be needed to make determination.
