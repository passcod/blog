## Me and the dark always

I drafted a game called **Me and the dark always** that tries to go against the
general practice / consequence of current designs that the "looking" action in
games is free. It ended up being a slice-of-life game concept which deals with
tiredness through a few aspects.

I've got most of the mechanics drawn up, some basic art sketches, the story
elements for a limited demo, and some vision down. I have a rough idea of the
high-level implementation. I'm aiming to continue developing the idea _on paper_
until Yule, then trying for a first playable in early 2018.

## Naema

In early July, I got inspiration for writing some of the chapters that were
missing from the current draft.

## Fanfiction

As usual, only "good enough to be listed" newly-read fics are, well, listed, and
not everything I've read during the month. Especially recommended fics are in
**bold**.
