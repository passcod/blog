title: Dark White 1-2

In among grassy hills and hedges of pines, the house looked almost out of place. It was a fine house, but it looked like it belonged in a suburban neighbourhood, not in the middle of nowhere. It has white smooth walls and a black slate roof, simple steel flashings adorning its ridges. The third floor windows were the only hint it might hide something more, their round brass frame and symmetrical quarter panes dripping black rust onto the plasterboard a reminder of the style that was ever-present centuries ago.

_A kink in the spellwork?_, Terri wondered. He took a few steps backward and sat down in the grass, his long thin hands weaving and caressing the plants and the earth, and concentrated on the magic running through the land. It was incredibly complex, a masterpiece of engineering unchallenged by the much poorer modern standards. It was old magic, from a time where its wielders still remembered how it had been created, and used that knowledge to build ever more efficient forms. Terri listened to it work for a while and then *reached* inside. He pushed and prodded, smelling and feeling the energy trace, connecting it to his nervous system, then sent an impulse, a request for information, and waited. A strong smell of strawberries wafted in his direction, and before long the magical network answered. A long stream of information poured into Terri's consciousness.

He cut it off after a minute, having found what he wanted to know. The spellwork was designed correctly, and functioned alright; the out-of-place windows were in fact a result of its programming. When the Morrigan family had moved into this place, nearly fifteen years ago, the house had been in a state of flux, uninhabited and therefore switching between its various forms at random. If the new residents had been wizards, it would have kept doing so, eventually settling onto the most convenient appearance for them. As it were, Caroline Morrigan was not, and is not, a magician. So the house panicked, tried to change completely before they arrived, and got stuck when they came over the hill.

He could feel a man arriving to the house with Caroline that first day, but could not identify him. He could feel the new life within her womb growing. He could feel the man leaving the house a short while (although the house's poor sense of time made precise timing difficult) afterwards, never returning. He could feel the house adjusting ever so slightly for the young Cindi: corners rounding while she learned to walk, so she wouldn't hurt herself when falling down, the steps of stairwells gaining width and height as her strides became greater and her feet larger, her room moving seasonally to benefit the most of the sun, until she became old enough to notice it.

To the incompetent, it would look as if the house liked children. This was not the case. The house was designed to accommodate its magical residents. Caroline wasn't. Therefore, Cindi was. Alternatively, someone could have put a spell on Cindi so the house would respond to her even if she wasn't magical herself, in such a way that the spellwork would not see the difference. Such a spell would require the caster to come back to strengthen and modify his work every so often, and it would also require him to observe both the house and Cindi and her mother to acertain whether or not a change was necessary. The work that entails made this very unlikely. Still, it was a possibility. Terri made a note to check for such frameworks at dinner or whenever he could.

He got up, and started walking back. It was early in the afternoon, and the sun was starting to weigh down on his head. There was no wind, not even a breeze, even though the top of the nearest cluster of trees was swaying gentlyâ€¦ _is the lack of wind another feature of the house, or is it simply nature's own device?_ he wondered. Checking this would have been a waste of time; sometimes comfort is not worth investigating, and doing so would either be long-winded or disappointing anyway. It was better to find a reclining chair and lie down in the shadow of the veranda.

He heard glass breaking and, alarmed, rushed inside and upstairs. When he reached Cindi's room, the strawberry smell was overwhelming. Some very crude magic had been at work here. He feared she had discovered her magic and burned herself. The truth was quite a bit more surprising.

A surprised-looking and bruised Cindi lay on the ground, various objects in pieces around the room, having seemingly crashed into the walls and through the window. The cause of the disaster remained unseen. He stared at Cindi. Sighing a bit, she sat down, brushed hair away from her face, and looked *up*. Flat against the ceiling, there was an old, grey carpet trembling and looking scared, as much as carpets can display emotions. When Cindi reached up, it scurried *away* from her and stuck itself in a corner.
