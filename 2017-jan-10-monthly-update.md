## Fanfiction

- {HP} [Prodigy](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy). Pretty good.
  I liked the modern take. A bit *too* prodigious perhaps, but that's what the
  title announced so who's complaining? Waaay crazy story. Do not read in more
  than one sitting, because there is SO MUCH SHIT HAPPENING and you'd end up
  horribly confused. Great stuff. {135k words}

- {HP} [Yet Another Universe](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6320683/1/Yet-Another-Universe).
  Well written. The sequel is good too, albeit much more brutal, and abandoned.

- {HP} [893](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7161848/34/893). Great story, good
  writing. Unsure how accurate the Japanese/Yakuza details are (but it's gotta
  be better than Rowling's own attempts at representing asians), and the large
  amount of Japanese words and phrases embedded in the text make it somewhat
  tougher to read. {360k words}

- {HP} [Return of the Marauders](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders).
  Consistently bad spelling and borderline grammar, but enjoyable story.
  Interesting original material. A bit too much angst at times. {370k words}

- {HP} [Harry Potter and the Connection Reversed](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9132770/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Connection-Reversed).
  Very amusing little short. A bit of a Deus Ex on that Horcrux business, but
  nevermind the details, there's not enough space for them anyway. {9.5k words}
