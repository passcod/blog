## Poetry imports

I “imported” (as in, moved/copied from elsewhere onto this blog) three poems,
one song, and one very short short piece of absurd fiction:

- [Only One Left](https://blog.passcod.name/2009/jul/28/only-one-left)
- [Slowly](https://blog.passcod.name/2013/nov/24/slowly)
- [so many alone at night](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/aug/16/so-many-alone-at-night)
- [Up Up And Away](https://blog.passcod.name/2014/feb/08/up-up-and-away)
- [ali.vei.nth.eni.ght](https://blog.passcod.name/2015/jan/10/alive-in-the-night)

## Fanfiction

As usual, only "good enough to be listed" newly-read fics are, well, listed, and
not everything I've read during the month. Especially recommended fics are in
**bold**.
