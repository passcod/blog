Prayer of the Lager, [as imagined by GGaR fans](http://disq.us/8hq5zr):

> Bar-father, whose pints are heavenly  
> Jo be Thy name  
> Thy fiefdom come  
> Thy beer be drunk  
> On Earth, as it is in Valhalla  
> Give us this day our liquid bread  
> And forgive our tabs  
> As we forgive those who have  
> Never bought the house a round  
> But never forgive he who orders a bud light  
> Amen.
