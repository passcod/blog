  <p>(to be read with a calligraphy pen or nib in your hand)</p>
<p>Grow.<br />
A word.<br />
A verb.<br />
Germanic.</p>
<p>Feel it.<br />
Slow.<br />
Old.<br />
Young.</p>
<p>Now I’ll tell you how put it on a page:<br />
we’ll start with the o.</p>
<p>Take your pen just so,<br />
thin first,<br />
from the center<br />
and thick on the up, thin at the top<br />
and thick on the down, thin at the low,<br />
finish sharply.</p>
<p>The r is a small-cap,<br />
nothing special,<br />
you’ve done these before.</p>
<p>Same with the w,<br />
but lowercase.</p>
<p>Now the G.<br />
The G is special.<br />
You have to put yourself into it.</p>
<p>Stare at the space<br />
before the letters,<br />
draw it in your mind—<br />
no, not like that,<br />
more majestic—<br />
give it respect;<br />
that G has held you all your life,<br />
even before you were made,<br />
it will hold you and your children,<br />
respect it, make it king,<br />
but not arrogant, as it’s old—<br />
older than the oldest tree,<br />
older than the eldest rock—<br />
and it’s wise,<br />
so wise…</p>
<p>Yes.<br />
Now you feel it.<br />
Take your pen.<br />
Close your eyes.<br />
Follow my hand.<br />
There you are.<br />
At the start.<br />
Keep ’em closed.<br />
Breath in.<br />
Breath out.<br />
Breath a half.<br />
Breath.</p>
<p>And throw forth your arm.</p>
