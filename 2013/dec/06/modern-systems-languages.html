  <p>A year or so ago, I started getting interested in two new, modern systems programming languages: <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>. After playing around a bit with both, I chose <strong>Go</strong> to program a few things I had floating around at the time: <a href="https://github.com/passcod/plong-server">plong</a>, a pseudo-p2p server which is essentially a WebSocket relay and signaling server; <a href="https://github.com/passcod/poele">poële</a>, a very simple queue / task processor using Redis; and <a href="https://github.com/passcod/double-map">double-map</a>, a new kind of data-structure which solves the problem of slow hashmap search for specific scenarios.</p>
<p>Enthused by my success with a fast, modern, typed, compiled, systems language, I started having ideas of more ambitious things: <strong>imaku-latte</strong> was about a novel DE/WM for X11, <strong>thesides</strong> was about an EC2-like service for micro tasks and scripts.</p>
<p>More recently, <strong>aldaron</strong> is a tree editor, and <strong>pippo</strong> is my long-standing attempt at designing an ever-better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dbms">DBMS</a> (current features include graphs, content-addressable low-level block store, powerful abstraction capabilities, transparent versioning and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write">COW</a>, stream writes, and being truly distributed).</p>
<p><strong>thesides</strong> died for various reasons. The others didn’t, really, they were aborted and/or infinitely delayed because Go is too high level. It doesn’t allow easy low-level memory manipulation, the C interface is annoying both ways, and other nitpicks.</p>
<p>I still like Go, but I think I’m going to try out Rust for these projects where low-level access, where a real C replacement, is needed. We’ll see how that goes.</p>
