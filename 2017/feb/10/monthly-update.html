  <h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of my weekends writing a Star Wars fanfic. I’m going to finish
it before I publish, to avoid publishing and then abandoning it when I
eventually realise I’ve written myself into a corner. It’s completely outlined,
and I’ve got some willing and eager proofreaders waiting for it, so I have
hope.</p>
<p>I’ve already got ideas for a sequel; if there’s interest I might be
working on that for a while, too. The sequel will contain <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/822330577307086849">a certain ship</a>.</p>
<p>No title as of yet, working title of my file was SW:E:SI at the beginning of
the month, but what it stood for was already outdated by the time I got to the
middle of the outlining, so I changed it to the non-commital “Master Kylo”.
Maybe it will stay that.</p>
<h2>300 Shorts</h2>
<p>I’ve moved my “300 Shorts” collection entirely to this blog, instead of its
previous home on Medium. I’ve also added <a href="../../../2015/jan/25/300-shorts.html">an introductory post</a>, which
additionally serves as a common ‘parent post’ for all the shorts, taking
advantage of my blog engine’s capabilities: it will add a link from each entry
to the main post, and add a list (with links) of all the entries onto that main
post.</p>
<p>I’ve also published two so-far-unpublished pieces from 2016 into this collection.
The first is a short poem written last year: <a href="../../../2016/oct/14/unlit.html">Unlit</a>. The second is a sci-fi
story originally written for a contest: <a href="../../../2016/aug/16/regulus.html">Regulus</a>. It is accompanied by a few
pages of <a href="../../../2016/aug/16/regulus-notes.html">notes and commentary</a>.</p>
<h2>Tourist</h2>
<p>Chapter Seven <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2017/01/21/tourist-seven/#comment-441">made me really happy</a> and I felt more bubbly than
usual writing its comment. Perhaps it was the ice-cream.</p>
<h2>Backup and Sync</h2>
<p>Discovered a very interesting paper, algorithm, and software: <a href="https://haneul.github.io/papers/metasync.pdf">MetaSync</a>. It
provides a sync utility that can store data across several services and even
replicate this data for maximum reliability and synchronisation speed. I have
yet to evaluate the solution in-depth for my needs, but it certainly sounds
promising.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the software is not quite as maintained nor modern as I
would wish it. For this reason, my next large Rust project will be to implement
the pPaxos algorithm, the core metasync library, a CLI frontend and a sync
Daemon, as well as some remote storage adapters (probably starting with
Dropbox, Google Drive, MEGASync), and some local storage middleware (selective
encryption, compression).</p>
<p>I’ll probably choose a different name, though, not only to avoid stepping on
toes, but also because I don’t quite believe “meta sync” to be a good
descriptor for what this does.</p>
<h2>Hyperion</h2>
<p>After several years (at least four, but it gets fuzzy before then) of quiet
research and occasional thought, I finally got the last insight into my very own
algorithm for hypergraphs (and their somewhat-optimised subset hypermaps).</p>
<p>My hypergraphs are optimised for a specific query: “give me all the vertices of
all the edges that contain the given vertex.” Hyperion executes that for any
arbitrary vertex with the same time complexity as the underlying substrate. For
a HashMap, that’s O(1).</p>
<p>Hyperion is also fairly good at memory space: it incurs only a small fixed
overhead per-vertex and per-edge. Other implementations of bimaps, hypermaps, or
hypergraphs use about twice the amount of memory as is input into them.</p>
<p>Using Hyperion is mostly about thinking differently about some data. Once you
understand that you essentially have a structure which can store <em>associations</em>
of objects and then retrieve the entire association given <em>any value within</em>,
in constant time… once you really understand the idea and start being able to
apply it to problems, that’s when it becomes interesting.</p>
<p>Hyperion is not quite ready for publication, but the concept is finished and a
full description of its algorithms — for insert, for query, for modification —
is done in pseudocode. An initial implementation in Rust, some analysis, a few
measurements, and better documentation remain to be completed.</p>
<h2>Fanfiction</h2>
<p>All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I explored the Harry Potter fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.
Contains occasional lemons. Fairly large proportion of Haphne.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>{HP/SW Legends} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11576387/1/The-Katarn-Side">The Katarn Side</a></strong>.</p>
<p>A very nice tale. While I enjoyed the story, I spent a lot of it using the
material as both inspiration and warning, given I was writing my very own
Star Wars fanfic at the same time. It convinced me <em>not</em> to write a Star Wars
× Harry Potter crossover, as I do not have nearly enough knowledge about the
Star Wars universe to pull it off. But it also gave me pointers at how to
interpret Jedi lore and dogma, a style guide when writing droid speech, and a
remedial course in basic Galactic tenets. I particularly liked the tonne of
potential the crossover’s universe has… many stories could have been written
within, but this one was finished and done, and the rest is up to us readers’
imagination. Rated T. {135k words}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{SW Legends} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5704904/1/The-Last-Jedi">The Last Jedi</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Rated T but should have been M. Probably. This is Dune, but in the Star Wars
universe, with more sex and less Bene Gesserit. It does a good job of showing
the horror of the amount of lives lost during space conflict, when billions
of lives cry out in the Force, and it has an actual effect on those
sensitive. In the original six, there is a whole three minutes spent on the
destruction of a planet and millions of souls; two Jedi briefly look up and
say, almost deadpan, that they felt two billion souls die… and then they go
back to what they were doing, barely affected. In TFA, Starkiller Base
destroys five planets — there are no estimates I could find on the population
of the system, but let’s put it in the high dozen billions, maybe even half a
trillion — and there is even less effect on the Force-sensitive. Like, come
on! Billions have just died. At least show the Force-touched having a
<em>little</em> emotion here, maybe. So, in The Last Jedi, our protagonist Tobin, as
a youngling, witnesses the killing of “merely” thousands and feels it in the
Force, and it disturbs him so greatly that he has to isolate himself and cry
for hours at a time. A trained Jedi Knight is shown as losing control of her
emotions in violent manner. Even a less-monstrously-sensitive Mirakula is
strained and isolates herself, even while she has lived through dozens or
hundreds of such events already and could be thought to be inured against the
horror. Anyway, as you may see, I liked this fic a lot. {185k words}</p>

<p>Good story. The plots are thought-out and I really appreciate the insight
into other characters. The entire Chamber of Secrets episode, in particular,
is as much about Ginny and her struggle against Tom, than it is about Harry
and Sirius and friends… and then after that, the experience didn’t just
completely not matter, there are credible post-trauma effects, and the people
around don’t just forget what they’ve been through either. Last volume is
unfinished at time of writing, but updated recently. I’m hoping for a
Harry/Ginny ship but not holding my breath: there’s a lot of potential still.

<p>Oh, that was beautifully done. It is really a work you have to read to
experience. A summary would not do it justice. A description could not hope
to cover its walks and turns. This is what people mean when they say you have
edit down such that only what is needed remains. It all comes together in its
final chapter, triggering understanding over all the previous ones, but still
leaving us with that uncertainty Hermione hinted to at the Grimmauld party:
that you cannot really be sure it was all his work, or not. {90k words}</p>

<p>Ongoing. By <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8024050/TheBlack-sResurgence">the same author</a> as Honour Thy Blood, and reusing the
original personalities and names of its supporting cast, which is an amazing
idea as I get to rediscover and appreciate them anew, in a much better
environment and not just in flashbacks, as paintings, or in history scenes.
Yes, this is a time travel fic. I like the way it’s written, and although
it’s not perfectly beta’d (there’s homophones and awkward phrasings) it’s
much better than HTB at that. Followed and looking forward to new chapters.

<p>It’s adult, it’s sweet, it’s funny, it’s lively. Not lively as in it’s joyful
and bounding and jumping around happily, but lively as in it’s about life.
You know that quote about how grown-up fiction is about english professors
wondering about who to fuck, and YA fiction is about overthrowing the
government and picking up the pieces? This is grown-up YA fiction. The
government has been overthrown, the villains have been defeated, and there’s
still the shit attitudes in society that caused it all in the first place —
but we’re working on that. There’s peace. But it’s the picking up of pieces
that remains to be done. Recovering from all you’ve lived, and figuring out
where you’re going. Treating all the fucked up stuff you’ve done and that’s
still in your head. Talking to people. Getting angry and pissed off and
breaking up and making up and it all not being the literal end of the world.
Living life. And slowly getting there. {137k words}</p>
