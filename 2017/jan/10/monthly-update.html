  <h2>Tourist</h2>
<p>There’s been two chapters of <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/tourist/">Tourist</a> this period, so naturally I’ve commented
with my impressions on both: <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2016/12/23/tourist-five/#comment-415">[1]</a>, <a href="https://notsafforwork.com/2017/01/07/tourist-six/#comment-423">[2]</a>. <strong>Tourist</strong> is
<a href="https://twitter.com/Wanderlustin">Saf</a>‘s current serial novel about AI and asexuality and depression and it’s
great! Not only do I love her writing, I love the themes and the way she
explores them. There’s a few scenes which evoke a very particular feeling I’ve
experienced, and it’s fascinating that Saf is able to make me remember how that
feeling is like just through her words. The writing was perhaps a little
hesitant at first, but it’s been getting better and better every chapter. The
latest chapter is excellent.</p>
<h2>New Keyboard</h2>
<p>I finally caved and <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/814001529057226755">pre-ordered</a> a <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/">Keyboard.io Model 01</a>. This
is an incredible-looking keyboard, carved out of solid wood, with an ergonomic
split configuration, individually-sculpted keycaps, and all the trimmings. It’s
a treat. I’ve been lusting over it for over a year, following their production
newsletter. I’ve finally decided just before the new year (the “deadline” in
the tweet refers to them giving away an extra keycap set if pre-ordered before
the end of 2016) that I deserve to spend a bit of money on myself, so let’s go.</p>
<p>They’re hoping for a delivery around Q1 2017, I’m hoping to have it before May.</p>
<h2>New laptop?</h2>
<p>Not for me, yet. But my brother is looking into an upgrade before starting his
second year at Uni (he got into med!) and was especially interested in the
Surface Pro. One hitch: they’re <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>We may have just found out a trick, though: by getting it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01606IDL0?tag=laptop-magazine-20&amp;th=1">through Amazon US</a>
and shipping it here, we save about $600 NZD off the in-NZ price, even if we
get it at the cheapest source here. We’re looking hard to see if there’s a
catch, but so far everything looks a-ok.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a Surface Pro…</p>
<h2>Backup &amp; Sync</h2>
<p>I’ve been outlining and tentatively speccing out my “perfect” backup and sync
solution. I briefly toyed with making it closed-source (to start with) but no,
if anything comes out of it, it will be open-source just like everything else.</p>
<p>The ideas mostly come from missing a decent and modern syncing and backup
daemon for Linux <strong>and</strong> other platforms. Something fire-and-forget, quietly
working to provide the best it can without disrupting you. Something that can
efficiently protect against ransom/encryption worms. Something that can be
paused to save bandwidth yet still sync the most important things right now so
you can work collaboratively on mobile connections and not have last night’s
photos clog your upwards link. Or, even better, something that figures out that
you’re on a slow connection and automatically prioritises syncs and backups
without intervention at all.</p>
<p>Behind it, a library and utility that efficiently and correctly syncs a local
and a remote, as a daemon and not just a single invocation (because Rsync
already exists), that works on all major platforms, and completely handles that
state may change on either side during its run. More than that, a library that
does not mandate the actual transport or endpoints, so it can be used to power
sync engines for not only my “something” above, but also Google Drive, Dropbox,
etc third-party clients.</p>
<h2>Rust</h2>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813691373643698176">released Cargo Watch 3.1.1</a>, a minor update to upgrade
dependencies, notably the Notify library to version 3. That brought event
debouncing, which should solve a few of the most common issues encountered.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Cargo Watch has been more or less supplanted by <a href="https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec">watchexec</a>, which
I have to admit is a superior albeit more generic alternative. I’m debating
retiring Cargo Watch, and focusing instead wholly on Notify. That, or making
Cargo Watch into more of a development tool than it was, and integrating
features such as port and socket management as first-class features, perhaps
combining the essential functionality of Node’s <a href="https://github.com/remy/nodemon">nodemon</a> and Ruby’s <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a>
into a single tool for the Cargo/Rust ecosystem.</p>
<h2>🂻</h2>
<p>(This isn’t new this month, but I got a question about it the other day.)</p>
<p>Not sure where I encountered this, but it’s a Jack of Hearts. (In case you
can’t see, the title of this section is the Unicode symbol for that playing
card.) Think “Jack of all trades”. It means (apparently, and that’s how I use
it for me) “pan/bi-amorous and poly-amorous”.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I didn’t listen to anything new until the New Year, as is my habit. During the
year, all the music I like goes into a big playlist called “Sort”. Then at the
end of the year I pick a name for my yearly playlist based on stars (first one
was “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5wS0AZ6nQ5BUGt36jYbvo0">Level Orion</a>”, then came “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5zkHK8ynwd3NdiAbA7Q8lK">Rain Stars</a>”, “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/5NtXFS8YFZtnDRvPNmKPOy">Llama Shepherd</a>”, and this
year’s “<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/4ROxOg5BYFe4SXo8YLEXrR">Carrier of the Dawn</a>”), and go through the Sort playlist sequentially,
either discarding or sorting into the yearly playlist and/or any of the few
thematic playlists I maintain (&quot;<a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/passcod/playlist/15G3i15GTFluL6jgwj7f70">Music for Making</a>&quot; for writing/coding music,
“Sing”, “Music Box” for songs I’d like to cover, etc).</p>
<p>This year the “Sort” playlist counted over 450 songs, and took me about two
weeks to go through. The “Carrier of the Dawn” playlist now numbers 224 tracks.</p>
<p>While last year my listening was dominated by <a href="https://www.blueman.com/">Blue Man Group</a>, <a href="http://www.eiffelnews.com/">Eiffel</a>, and
<a href="http://www.woodkid.com/">Woodkid</a>, this year I’ve enjoyed a lot of <a href="http://jinoki.net/">Jin Oki</a>, <a href="http://www.thomasbergersen.com/">Thomas Bergensen</a>, <a href="http://zero7.co.uk/">Zero
7</a>, <a href="https://www.asgeirmusic.com/">Ásgeir</a>, <a href="http://www.hiromiuehara.com/">Hiromi</a>, and some 19th century compositors like Chopin and
Beethoven. Of course, the full list is much more varied than just these seven.</p>
<p>In the past 10 days I’ve started listening to new music again.</p>
<h2>Fanfiction</h2>
<p>All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I explored the Harry Potter fanficdom, all nearly exclusively rated M.
Contains lemons. Content warning for sexual assault in at least half the fics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>{HP} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy">Prodigy</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty good. I liked the modern take. A bit <em>too</em> prodigious perhaps, but
that’s what the title announced so who’s complaining? Waaay crazy story. Do
not read in more than one sitting, because there is SO MUCH SHIT HAPPENING
and you’d end up horribly confused. Great stuff. {135k words}</p>

<p>Great story, good writing. Unsure how accurate the Japanese/Yakuza details
are (but it’s gotta be better than Rowling’s own attempts at representing
asian ~~stereotypes~~ characters), and the large amount of Japanese words and
phrases embedded in the text make it somewhat tougher to read than usual.

<p>Short and sweet. Graphic at times. Cathartic ending and skillful munchkin

sheer contrarian nature of some of the cretinous parts of fandom. {78k words}</p>

<p>Good writing, great humour, manageable gore and satisfying battle scenes. Oh,
and let’s not forget the lore and world-building of epic proportions. The
finale in <strong>Lord</strong> was exactly what was needed. There are supposedly
continuations, but do yourself a favour and ignore both <strong>Variation</strong> and
<strong>Apocalypse</strong>. They’re unfinished, apparently abandoned, and reek of Bad
Sequel Syndrome. The only worthwhile point of note is that indeed (rot13)

<p>Despite claiming, as is usual, that all belongs to Rowling, this fic really
only uses the characters and some general elements of plot. The universe is
one of the most original I have ever read. It is an utterly different world,
and extremely well built and detailed. Not content to be defined over a few
departure points, it is rich of several dozen centuries of history with a
particular focus, due to the story, around Europe, the British Isles, and the
Americas. But this world is dark and cruel and bleak, and that itself is a
terrible understatement. Content warnings for sexual and otherwise abuse,
exploitation, horror… and yet that feels like too little said. It is a very
good work. It surpasses many original, published, novels I have read in the
genre. But while it hooked me and wouldn’t let me go as I devoured it, each
further installment shook me deeper. Even with an active imagination and few
of the ’moral’ blockers on thought most my peers have, this world and its
inhabitants shocked me in their depravity and casual evil, but most
importantly, in the way it showed every single cause and character as
believing they were in the right, even while performing and perpetuating
wickedness, resulting in institutionalised malevolence in every situation and
at every level of society. Even the heroes, the protagonists, the good ones,
those trying to quite literally save the world from itself, are merely
<em>questionably good</em> most of the time. It is a dark, dark work, but it is
very, very good. It’ll haunt me for a while. If you at all can, <strong>read it.</strong>

<p>{Naruto} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7977390/1/Life-in-Konoha-s-ANBU">Life in Konoha’s ANBU</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting format, with distinct arcs corresponding to Naruto’s missions
instead of a single continuity of plot. It makes the whole thing more
approachable, and sets clear expectations around the progression of a
particular writing stint. Unfinished, but not abandoned; there are long-term
plot lines still in suspens (and I’m not talking about the canon plot lurking
in the background, rather about the original plot lines that make it all
interesting). {370k words at time of writing}</p>

<p>I really like Darth Marrs’ writing. The emotions and complexity of every
character are well-rendered, the plots are well-rounded, and the suspens is
heart-wrenching. Yes, I have shed some tears and my heart has hurt. It’s not
the best fic on this list, and it was a short fun read, despite all the
feels, but it was pretty good. {190k words}</p>

<li>
<p>{HP} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985543/1/The-Forgotten-Contract">The Forgotten Contract</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yet another marriage contract story. What can I say? I like
romance, and this is one of the most popular and least sappy romance genre in
this fandom. I found the basis for the story interesting, and the resolution
swift if perhaps a bit anti-climatic. But then again, the defeat of Voldemort
was never the focus of the plot. The fic brushed on <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/813949273528102912">some thoughts</a>
I had while reading, namely on the influence Harry’s near worship for a
decade, without having a real person to mellow it, would have had on society,
particularly regarding standards of appearance and, to a lesser extent,
behaviour. There was a strange consistent corruption to the spelling of some
words, almost as if the text had been OCR’d: notably, various ‘I’ or ‘i’
letters had been replaced with ‘1’, but not all of them. {165k words}</p>

<p>{HP} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness">To Fight The Coming Darkness</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/940359/jbern">Jbern</a> rarely disappoints. This was a fun story, but not a Humour story.
Typical plot of Individual!Harry going against Dumbledore, but various
atypical plot elements, mostly around making typically-always-good characters
have questionable morals and make less-than-Light decisions, and making
typically-always-evil characters be borderline good but forced in a bad
situation. It adds an interesting realism. Few bad points, but one in
particular (rot13): va gung lrf, gurer vf n cybg-rkphfr sbe ebznapr gb tb
snfgre bapr Uneel naq Fhfna ner vaibyirq, ohg <em>orsber</em> gurer’f abg. Fb gung
cneg bs gur fgbel srryf n ovg gbb snfg sbe gung ernfba. Good discussions and
reasoning in dialogue, it changes from both naïve or
overcomplex-in-hopes-of-sounding-smart plans and narration simply omitting
planning and showing only the results. Including planning that actually feels
intelligent is a great addition to any story. {340k words}</p>

<li>
<p>{HP} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7453087/50/Pride-of-Time">Pride of Time</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This was really really good. I love Hermione time travel stories. I love when
all the characters have their own flame, their own passions and thoughts and
reasons and defects. I also really love stories that were planned out before
they were written, and written before they were published, as they are
invariably of better quality, simply due to having been revised and
cross-written. Contains graphic sex, but gentle and hot and furious and
<em>real</em>. Some scenes reminded me of sex I’ve had, see, that’s how good and
real it was. Also contains instances of graphic violence, but not gore, and
not deeply disturbing. It covers war (both of them) and terror and torture,
but it’s not meant to shock and disgust. If you read nothing else on this
list, I do recommend this one. {555k words}</p>

<p>{HP} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path">Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path</a>.</p>
<p>This list is getting way too long, but fortunately we’re two days before this
update goes out and the next few fics I have queued are crackfics or
small-length fics, so they should all make it into the short format list
below. Well-written, and with a delightful amount of lesbian, gay, and bi
characters, all presented positively, little prejudice in this regard all
around. Also remarkably good with letting everyone be happy with their
various religions, while calling out cultural misappropriation. No trans or
enbies that I could find, but we’re getting there. I’ve noticed several
possible references to HPMoR; generally I chalk those up to coincidence
because the fics are HPMoR-antecedent, but this one is mid-to-late 2016, so
it fits, and the references are multiple and fairly clear. Happy-ending fic,
even more so than the other happy-ending fics I’ve read recently; this is
positively Disney-esque in its epilogue. Although it’s certainly <em>not</em>
Disney-esque in its contents, with sex à gogo, lots of innuendo, etc. There’s
also violence and abuse present, this isn’t an all-rainbows fest. One
persistent bad point: the cavalier way horrific fates are dished onto some
antagonists. Sure, it might seem like karmic retribution, but cheerfully
finishing off Malfoy by having him be taken by <em>human traffickers intent on
forcing him into prostitution</em> still leaves a bad taste in. {520k words}</p>
