  <p>My mountain is Knowledge.</p>
<p>When the ship of my early childhood approached the land of life, knowledge is
what I saw and what I started seeking. My journey began on the coast, where I
learned to walk, and then I looked up, and saw all that I could climb. The slope
was steep, the rock slippery, the path barely walked. And when I reached up to
the summit I had glimpsed as a child, I found that it had merely been the place
where earth meets the bottom of the clouds, and that my mountain continued
upwards, and that its true summit I could never see at all.</p>
<p>But this did not discourage me.</p>
<p>And as I turned around and gazed over all I could see from here, and all that I
had achieved in this climb, I knew that I would continue, forever if need be, in
my quest upon the mountain of Knowledge.</p>
