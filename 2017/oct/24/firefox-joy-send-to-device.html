  <p>I’ve seen a lot of noise about Firefox Quantum recently, and rightfully so:
it’s faster, smoother, it uses Rust, it’s doing a lot of awesome things.
There’s also demos of the Firefox Devtools, with the CSS Grid utilities and
other goodies.</p>
<p>Personally, though, it’s a much humbler detail of recent Firefoxes that has
improved my life the most: the <strong>send tab to device</strong> feature.</p>

and sending a tab to my phone.

<p>It’s a feature that brings back those UIs in movies and TV where you see people
flicking documents between screens, and jabbing their handhelds forward to pass
a presentation over onto the big screen. This is now possible on Firefox
without the tired routine of copy-pasting the link in a chat or email or
evernote, or saving it as a bookmark and then searching for it on the other
side.</p>
<p>Nowadays, if I’m reading something on my phone and want to continue more
comfortably on my laptop, it’s three taps and a few seconds later, tada! it’s
there.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/20qqj7V.jpg" alt="mobile menu with “send to device” button highlighted" /></p>
<p>But beyond flicking between devices, the feature is useful for other workflows.
You don’t need to have both devices on hand or even on for it to work.</p>
<p>One thing I now do often is send articles to my home laptop after finding them
while browsing at work. It reduces procrastination and distraction because I
trust these tabs not to be lost, and yet they are into the ether, out of sight
and mind until I get back home.</p>
<p>I’ve sent entire volleys of tabs over to the office after starting to debug a
fault while still at home, and then hopping in my car when things calm down a
bit. When I arrive twenty minutes later I can just jump back in to whatever I
was doing, and with the “Tabs on other devices” menu I can even pull other
things I was looking at that I didn’t send over initially.</p>
<p>It’s a tiny feature, but it’s changed my usage a lot — for the better.</p>
