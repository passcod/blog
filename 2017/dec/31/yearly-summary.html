  <h2>This year</h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../2016/dec/10/blogging-more-and-starting-on-new-year-resolutions-early.html">the post that started this whole monthly blogging thing</a>, I
outlined three things I wanted to do this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improve my accent.</p>
<p>Hiring a speech therapist didn’t work out, because (predictably) it turns
out that 1) there’s not many actually specialised in the particular narrow
field of accent correction, 2) those that are are fully booked for the
foreseeable future, and 3) none of them are near Whangarei <em>anyway</em>.</p>
<p>But I’ve been speaking a lot more, to more people. I’m no extrovert, but I
think I’ve been progressing nonetheless. I’ll continue working at it. At
some point I’d like to do some meetup and then conference speaking, too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve my health.</p>
<p>I’ve lost about 5 kg since the beginning of the year. More than that, I’ve
built up some muscle mass and established healthier habits. I’ve changed
jobs, going from a highly stressful place where I burned out several times,
to a more rewarding <em>and</em> more relaxing opportunity. I sleep better, in part
because of more regular and longer cycles, and in part because I have
improved my sleeping posture. There are other little things that add up. But
it’s looking up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve my writing.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve definitely done well here. Just in this blog, I have written more
this year than every single previous year, <em>combined</em>. I’ve authored several
pieces of fanfiction, and published three. Most importantly, I’ve really
enjoyed myself. I write better and faster now, even though I don’t think
I’ll ever be someone who can bang out a novel in a few months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next year</h2>
<p>I’m not sure I have big goals I want to achieve in 2018. But here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I want to read 300 books.</p>
<p>That’s hard-copy, deadtree books with words in them. They’ll all be library
books unless I buy a few or get given some. Three hundred books is about six
books a week, which sounds definitely doable, but we’ll see how I go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to improve my health more.</p>
<p>Mostly walking more, exercising more, getting less pear-shaped if I can help
it. My diet is fine now. It’s just the exercising. No strong goals here, but
I’d like to see fuzzily-defined improvement before the winter, at least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to release a medium-sized creative project.</p>
<p>It could be the Star Wars fanfic I’ve been working on, on and off, all year.
It could be something else. I’ve got a few ideas for a game. Either way, I
want to work at it and be in a position to release something during the year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The coming years</h2>
<p>I was asked that during nano because I semi-jokingly said my next availability
to play the latest pokemons would be in mid-2019. So: my current “high-level
todolist” for the next few years goes like this, in no particular order. There
are priorities and schedules but they’re fuzzy / private.</p>
<ul>
<li>The three things listed above for 2018.</li>
<li>Project: Notify v5. From that will follow Cargo Watch, I’m not counting it.</li>
<li>Gameplaying: <a href="https://managore.itch.io/reap">Reap</a></li>
<li>Project: Irmo. Experiment: an associative knowledge store, machine learning?</li>
<li><del>Gameplaying: Assassins’ Creed Origins</del></li>
<li>Gameplaying: A recent Pokemon, perhaps</li>
<li>Gameplaying: Eco</li>
<li>Gameplaying: A contemporary FPS or two</li>
<li>Gameplaying: a bunch of other indie games</li>
<li>Project: casting my own keycaps</li>
<li>Project: make mead</li>
<li>Gamemaking: another game. I have ideas.</li>
<li>Writing: another fic in the dawnverse</li>
<li>Writing: a non-Star Wars fic. Again, I have ideas.</li>
<li>Writing: original fiction. I have various drafts.</li>
<li>Project: instrumenting a hive</li>
<li>Cons: WorldCon 2019 and 2020</li>
<li>Cons: NZGDC? Perhaps 2019 rather than 2018</li>
<li>Cons: Kiwiruby and another NZ.js, at least</li>
<li>Buying a small boat</li>
<li>Buying an electric car</li>
<li>Going to Europe (2019): Ireland, France, other countries</li>
<li>Visiting the South Island</li>
<li>Visiting the tropics again (I haven’t been in ages)</li>
<li>Another job after Uber (I plan staying there 2-3 years NO MORE)</li>
<li>If I can, a product/SaaS/something… being self-employed/entrepreneur</li>
<li>Finish next year’s nano with 50k words</li>
</ul>
<p>and more.</p>

<h2>Donations</h2>

world a better place. This year, I chose to give 5% of my estimated income.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Total: $2800)</p>
<h3>Patreon</h3>
<p>Aside from my 5% donations, I also gave $960 to various creators on Patreon.</p>
<h2>Fanfiction</h2>
<h3>Written</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11542755">Empire Day on Thabeska</a></li>
<li><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/11809908">In that bright land from which I come</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/12722796">Chosen Names</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13125189/chapters/30026574">How to Fall to the Dark Side in Ten Minutes and Save Jerks from Themselves</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Read</h3>
<p>Words of fanfic read per month, based on the monthly update posts. Thus the
figure is low-balled as the posts don’t include fics I read but didn’t like, nor
the updates for incomplete works I follow. And it of course doesn’t include all
I read that <em>wasn’t</em> fanfic.</p>
<ul>
<li>December 2016 → January 2017: 5,399k</li>
<li>January → February: 6,416k</li>
<li>February → March: 2,964k</li>
<li>March → April: 2,199k</li>
<li>April → May: 3,325k</li>
<li>May → June: 2,567k</li>
<li>June → July: 1,969k</li>
<li>July → August: 992k</li>
<li>August → September: 1,727k</li>
<li>September → October: 1,868k</li>
<li>October → November: 876k</li>
<li>November → December: 1,382k</li>
