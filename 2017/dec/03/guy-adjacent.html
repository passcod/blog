  <p>I think I’ve finally figured out a name for my gender identity thing that feels
okay. Not super great. But… okay.</p>
<p>I’m not enby. Like, I’m <em>technically</em> non-binary, agender something, but also
like no. I’m not taking this label for myself. I feel like I would be taking
space away from others if I used that. I don’t have most of the issues and
struggles I see and witness other non-binaries go through.</p>
<p>I’m not discriminated against in any real way. I don’t have gender-related
dysphoria, or maybe just a tiny bit that I’m not completely sure is really
about gender at all. It’s hard to tell.</p>
<p>So it feels like you’re all this giant awesome fucked up family and I’m the one
well-adjusted person in the middle of it.</p>
<p><s>So I’m <strong>guy-adjacent</strong>.</s></p>
<p>I don’t particularly like the word guy? But it works here in a way
“man-adjacent” doesn’t. I’m not a guy. I’m… adjacent.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
