  <h2>NZ.js</h2>
<p>As this is published, I am at <a href="http://conference.javascript.org.nz/">a JavaScript conference</a> in Wellington.</p>
<p>Now, as I write this, I have <em>no idea</em>, but I’m pretty sure I’m going to love
the talks and keynotes by <a href="https://twitter.com/aurynn">@aurynn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbot">@rockbot</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/riblah">@riblah</a>, and others.</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>In January, I weighed about 87kg. <a href="https://twitter.com/passcod/status/828706886107082752">In February</a>, I got down to
85kg. At the 1st of March, I weighed 84kg. Three weeks prior, my brother, who
is an accomplished (if only by hobby) sportsman, and a second-year Med student,
made the comment that given my stature and eating habits, he expected I could
be <em>slim</em> if I did just a little bit more exercise. Thus, in March, I am upping
my exercise from a 30-minute walk three times a week to the same, but every
day… and with an eye to increase again in, say, two months.</p>
<h2>Ops School</h2>
<p>I found this: <a href="http://www.opsschool.org/">http://www.opsschool.org/</a> and have
started on it.</p>
<p>I don’t think I want to pivot onto Sysadmin / Syseng roles, but I am always in
quest of knowledge to both make me more effective and combat my (waning,
thankfully) impostor syndrome.</p>
<h2>Master Kylo</h2>
<p>Currently going through a second round of detailed outlining, after changing
the start point of the story and some perspective details, as well as a
deepening of the original style. I’m still aiming for at least a beta release
on Star Wars Day, but I may miss the mark.</p>
<h2>Blograph</h2>
<p>The engine this blog runs on is a custom-built server designed and implemented
over three years ago when I tired at not having the options I needed, and just
decided to make it my way. However, I also didn’t touch it much in those three
years. Over time, some bugs were discovered, a few missing features exposed,
and one large element of the design was never actually used — while creating a
performance limiter nonetheless.</p>
<p>Also, I needed an exercise to get back into Rust.</p>
<p>So I did a blackbox reimplementation of my blog, plus a few missing features,
minus two obsolete ones. I made it a hybrid of Rust and JavaScript, using Neon
to bridge the two. I <a href="https://blog.passcod.name/2017/mar/05/lighting-up-rust-with-neon">blogged about some patterns</a> I encountered
when wrangling the Neon bindings.</p>
<p>The new version has upwards of 300 tests (170 on the Rust side, and more than
that on the JS side), sports a <strong>5x</strong> performance boost, has up-to-spec
CommonMark rendering and new footnote support, and is a lot more <em>consciously
designed</em> instead of haphazardly put together. It’s live; you’re reading this
article on an instance right now.</p>
<h2>Fanfiction</h2>
<p>All in reading order within their sections. Word counts are rounded to nearest
1 or 5k. I finished (for the moment!) my exploration of the Harry Potter
fanficdom, fics rated at least T, often M.</p>
<ul>

<p>{HP} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11280068/78/The-Brightest-Witch-and-the-Darkest-House">The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11677935/1/The-Hogwarts-Six-and-The-Darkest-Wizard">The Hogwarts Six and the Darkest Wizard</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Has complex plots without being over-complicated, and makes very good use of
foreshadowing and including events several chapters before they’re used,
without any flashback at all. Probably the best use of actually-explained
time travel mechanisms I have ever read since HPMoR, and it probably
surpasses that, even: used hundreds of times, over a year thrice folded on
itself… our protagonist uses time travel to the best she can, and all such
plots are explained and/or can be reasoned out, unlike in HPMoR where we are
told Dumbledore+Snape+Potter-Evans-Verres make plans and schemas and diagrams
but there’s only one or two times the time travel is actually shown and
explained. And even with such a tool, Valeria (our OC protagonist) doesn’t
depend entirely on it to accomplish her plans! Manipulation, advance
planning, munchkinning, and other techniques all combine together in an
explosive mix, with no less than three different plots going on at the same
time… at any given time. And that’s just the first book! The second book is
ongoing, and I am loving it. {274k + 131k words atow}</p>

<p>This is brilliant. Also fun and humourous and just the right amount of
flirty. Long chapters, lots of action: physical, verbal, and otherwise.
There’s a very hot dominant sex scene right at the start of the second
chapter, preceded (at the end of the first) by a bunch of realistic in-public
affection and… more. It’s honestly refreshing, after decidedly adult fics
that nevertheless ellide any actual action, and a wide corpus of fics that
deal with more or less horny teenagers instead of mature (<em>cough</em> as if
<em>cough</em>) young adults. Ongoing. {60k words atow}</p>

<p>I love the perspective into and out of all the characters, especially Ahsoka
and Aayla. The analysis and conflicting opinions of power structures with the
Galaxy by an outsider that still has considerable experience that is more or
less relatable, and by insider people both accepted and excluded from those
same structures, yields interesting discussions packed with details. The “too
many assumptions” thing resonated particularly with me, as it is something I
struggle with when interacting with some people I know (they make assumptions
that are often wrong or incomplete and draw concludions from that, without
ever pausing to ask themselves or others about them, and end up making wild
accusations that are hard to defend upon on the spot (and they then take that
hesitation as admission of guilt, instead of confusion or trying to organise
thoughts) as I need to think about what their assumptions could be that they
end up there; the entire exercise is very frustrating). There are spectacular
scenes of magic and action, the forces involved are of epic proportions, and
yet humour both by characters and by story is pervasive. It’s a good mix.
Ongoing. {315k words atow}</p>

<li>
<p>{HP} <strong><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes">Behind Blue Eyes</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It starts like any other teenager romance… well, the troubled ones anyway.
Girl runs away from home, boy runs away from life, they meet and fall into
friendship first, and then into love. But the likeness stops here. Because
this is a Harry Potter story, and that means heartbreak, it means danger, it
means terror, it means conflict and drama and emotions running high in all
directions. It means magic, and all the problems that brings with it. It
means love. And so <em>Behind Blue Eyes</em> finishes like few other adult romances…
with pain and loss and success and that particular kind of happiness that is
like the flame of a phoenix: strong and bright, reborn many times, and
fiercely everlasting. {440k words}</p>

Interesting idea of the continuous universe: SW first, then HP millions of years later, in the same universe. Another story I just read had the same idea, but inverted. {156k + 128k atow}</li>
<li>{SW/HP} <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano">Harry Tano</a>. Fandom tag reversed as it’s not a Harry-in-StarWars story like many others, but a Ahsoka-in-HP story. {136k words}</li>
