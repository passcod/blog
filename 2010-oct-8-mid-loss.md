Dark.

_Mid-Dawn_

Softly I walk  
forward. In the  
first light of the  
waking sun. My mind  
still and clear and  
white and black. Yet I  
step up down and go  
to the usual things of  
the day. All that time  
Life  
is what I think about.  
Love  
is what I ache about.  
Pain  
is what my heart is.  
Death  
is where my heart goes.  

The sun is falling

Wait for me --

_Mid-Dusk_
