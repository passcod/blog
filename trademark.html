  <p>As of August 2018, and if everything went well, “<strong>passcod</strong>” is now a
trademark I own personally. An official, registered, paid for and in the books,
proper trademark.</p>
<p>This was done for several reasons, three really:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because I wanted to see if it was possible, and it was cheap enough, and
didn’t require much effort at all, so might as well try it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because very early in the year, someone approached me about the name, and I
couldn’t really tell if it was a scam or not, so I took it at face value
just in case, did a lot of reading, asked a lawyer, and told them politely
what was mine and what they could do with the rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because “passcod” is my <strong>name</strong>, and that means something. But while there
are protections around my legal name simply by virtue of being mine, there
is no such thing around this name of mine. I wanted to permanently tie the
name to myself (where “permanently” is “10 years, renewable”), and have it
recognised as such by the law and the land.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I thought of making a little guidebook document thing that outlines what you
can do with this trademark without explicitely asking me, but all the rules are
kinda fuzzy because of it being a person-name and not a thing-name. So the deal
goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“passcod” is me. When you use the name, you’re referring to me. In
consequent, you can use the name to refer to me. But:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do something I don’t like with the name, I have the right to tell you
off. If you persist, I have the right to tell you off in stronger terms,
possibly accompanied by some form of legal retribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No contract or license or legal document gives you any further right to the
name unless I give you authorisation (in writing, explicit, signed) to do
so. If I do for anyone, this line will be amended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This list may be appended to or modified at any time without notice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not meant to be a <em>change</em> that has effects on what you do, unless you
were planning to be a dick about it. It’s about making it very clear that
something is my name. Privately, I’m having a little personal ritual on the day
this goes through, but that’s for me to enjoy. Then I’ll probably go have a
drink with friends, and that will be that.</p>
