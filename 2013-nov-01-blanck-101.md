①  
empty space  
not black  
not white  
not noise  
blanck  

②  
voices around  
still blanck  
blanck still  
around voices  

③  
an eternity  
passed me by  
voices again  
I can understand now  
"Head trauma."  
"Vision centre."  

④  
smell  
taste  
antiseptic  
metallic  

⑤  
soft cotton  
soft pillow  
soft blanket  

⑥  
my eyes  
are wide open  
and i see  
nothing
